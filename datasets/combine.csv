Ideas, suggestions, guides, workouts, etc -- everything you'll need to answer 99% of questions! This is meant to be a community/collaborative effort, so please add in suggestions in the comments!

To be clear on a couple terms -- when exercising and eating to gain weight, that is called **bulking** (aka caloric ""surplus""). Eating less to lose weight is called **cutting** (aka caloric ""deficit""). And eating just enough to not gain or lose weight is called **maintenance** (aka recomposition or ""recomp"").

#A visual guide to male and female BF% estimates

I don’t like guessing BF% as there’s no way to know how much visceral fat we store internally. But athleanx’s general guidelines are as good as any for visual estimates.

#Who should cut or bulk?

The idea behind cut and bulk cycles is to gain muscle and fat in a bulk phase and then try to keep all your muscle and burn off fat in a cut phase. This approach is generally 'faster', when done correctly, than ""recomps"" (recompositions) where you maintain your weight but work out hard and try to replace fat with muscle.

Generally speaking, if you're an active person and/or consistently working out, you can do cut/bulk cycles. To get started, you need to know your **maintenance** calories (""maint"") to have an idea on how many calories you can consume without gaining or losing weight, hence the term maintenance; no change in weight. To bulk, you eat more than maintenance (aka ""surplus"") and to cut you eat less than maintenance (aka ""deficit""). If you *are not* working out and you bulk, that's how you get fat. So don't eat above maint if you're not also working out. 

#Getting started

To get started, you need to know your ""maintenance"" calorie needs and for an estimate you need a TDEE calculator (I like [this one](https://tdeecalculator.net/), but you can google for others). Think of this as a starting point to use that will need some adjusting over time.

Once you have an estimated maintenance, you generally add 250-500 calories for a bulk and subtract 250-750 calories in a cut. Generally, it's safer to over-do cuts and under-do bulks. In a bulk you gain both fat and muscle and after a point you only gain fat (fat stores faster than you can build new muscle), so be cautious in bulks and don't ""dirty"" bulk. 

#Deciding to cut or bulk

So far as I'm aware, there isn't a hard science behind *when* to bulk or cut, but there are guidelines to consider. When bulking, our bodies build muscle *and* store fat and, after a point, our bodies prioritize storing fat over building muscle. This is why dirty bulking is bad and, generally speaking, if your BF% is &gt; 20%, you should not bulk. Any higher BF% and your body tends to prioritize fat storage vs muscle gained from bulking.

Similarly, cuts are usually done to around 10% because any lower than that and the body will begin to consume more muscle than fat and muscle loss is more likely.

You *can* make strength gains on a cut. You can't build new muscle, but you can ""refactor"" (that's my word for it, I'm sure there's a scientific one) existing muscle to be more efficient, hence stronger, as you lose fat. Also, repetitive gym visits will help you become more proficient at working out which helps in the long run when you start bulking and building new muscle.

If you're really unsure, you can make a post in /r/BulkOrCut to get community feedback on what it's you personally should do.

If you're skinnyfat, generally you can eat at a small maintenance (aka ""clean bulk"") and make great strength gains. If you have little muscle mass to cut to, you will just look tiny/thin -- especially if you're tall. So for most skinnyfat people, and I would clean bulk and diligently follow a legit lifting routine. Which brings me to...

#Workout routines

Before getting into routines, I think it's worth mentioning first that **everyone should walk more**. At least 5 times per week, 30 minutes per day:

* [Get ripped. Get walking.](https://www.t-nation.com/training/get-ripped-get-walking)

Check out [The Beginner's Guide to Working Out](https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/ihz264/beginners_guide_to_working_out/).

The best workout routine is the one you can consistently follow. If you're new to the gym, just about anything will get you some results. To a point. If you want to be smart about it, **do not make up your own routine!** There are plenty of legit, tried-and-true, FREE [recommended lifting routines](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/) to choose from. I like these routines vs googling something random because these are routines many, many people in various subreddits are doing and have done in the past that can help answer any questions you might have. It's nice to have someone else that is doing or has done the program you're running to offer direct advice from their experience. But you can just google other routines if you want. Just make sure it has:

* 1) Progressive overload

* 2) Structured days to not hit body parts more than 2x/week

If you're working out at home, check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/GovSchwarzenegger/comments/flz3es/stay_at_home_stay_fit/) from Arnold Schwarzenegger with a detailed bodyweight home routine.

#What to eat

At the end of the day, for 99% of people (various diseases, ailments, and conditions aside), all that matters are Calories In, Calories Out (CICO). This controls weight **gain** and **loss**. Lifting heavy weights encourages **strength gains** or at least strength maintenance in both surplus/bulks and deficit/cuts. But to gain or lose lbs on a scale, the total calories consumed minus calories used and the resulting surplus/deficit are what matters. But how much of what you eat matters...

There's a lot of suggested science over what to eat, but there are generally sound rules of thumbs to follow which are easily broken down into ""Macros"" for tracking purposes:

* Proteins (1 gram = 4 calories)

* Carbs (1 gram = 4 calories)

* Fats (1 gram = 9 calories)

Collectively, all the macros we consume = total consumption (Calories In). When cutting, it's easiest to cut down fats and carbs. But keep protein high. When bulking, generally you add carbs and/or fats. Protein should always be high; it's what helps build muscle directly.

However, *how we feel* when consuming these calories and what we get out of other nutrients is important.

##Fats

We all need healthy fats to help regulate hormonal balances. This is usually room-temp fats (think extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, various nuts, avocados, etc); less important are the fats in meat and dairy products, for example. A general rule of thumb is to aim for at least **30% x total calories** for your fats macro. This is the same for cutting or bulking, but when bulking you can increase if you want.

E.g. if you're consuming 2000 calories daily, aim for 0.3x2000 (600) calories to be from fats.

##Carbs

Next come carbs. Carbs are not evil. They're a tool. Our body prefers and relies on carbs to refuel energy stores. Simple, nutrient-dense carbs are preferred -- not complex or junk carbs. The reason for this is 1) satiation, how long we'll feel full, and 2) other nutrient content. When you can, get your carbs from fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. That will do far more for you than crackers, cereal, donuts, etc. Even though the carbs will be utilized equally, produce holds far more vitamins and minerals that have relevant health and recovery benefits that can't be overstated.

Generally, aim for **25-45%** of your calories to be carbs (depending on cutting/bulking).

##Protein

Generally, you want to keep protein fairly high. Anywhere from **.75-1+ gram of protein per lbs of body weight.** This can come from any source, as our body will utilize them the same. But some sources are preferred, depending on whether you're cutting or bulking. Ideally, aim for now more than 40-50 grams per meal/protein shake and spread out the consumption through the day.

The remainder of your calories should be protein.

##Timing

As carbs are for energy, many people prefer to have more carbs timed around workouts (and no fats during this period) to help boost performance and recovery. If you're going to eat your carbs (e.g. rice and chicken breast), do so about two hours before working out; otherwise, liquid/quickly consumed carbs are preferred (e.g. orange or apple juice). Again, post-workout, get simple carbs and protein into your system via a shake or meal fairly soon. Save fats for well-before or after workouts.

#Measuring success

First and foremost, gym progress should always be factored in first. If your routine says X lift should go up Y amount each week, generally you want to be hitting that to know you're on track. If your lift #s are going up according to your routine, you're doing great! If you aren't, there's a breakdown somewhere and you should ask for guidance if you cannot asses the fail point yourself.

Secondly, the weight scale. You want to make sure your body weight is trending in your goal direction. It's ideal to weigh yourself *the same way* every time. 

For example, I wake up, go to the bathroom, and then weigh myself every day for three weeks and then I average my daily changes over those three weeks. I generally aim to gain .5-.75 lbs per week and lose .75-1 lbs per week. If I'm gaining or losing too much, I adjust my macros ~ 250 calories and measure again for three weeks and so on.

Don't get caught up daily changes; I sometimes vary 3-5 lbs between days! Weigh daily for three weeks and average it out. Don't worry about the daily weight, find an average to determine where the trend is taking you and adjust if needed. This will take the annoying variances out of the picture and let you focus on meaningful change.

You can also measure your wrists, waist, neck, etc, as well as take photos, but that's more preference and not as commonly suggested.

#Bulking and cutting strategies

I've seen people make amazing progress, both gaining and losing weight, in a variety of ways. Ideally, be healthy. Emphasize fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. But, at the end of the day, **many approaches work**. You can bulk or cut as a vegan, intermittent fasting (""IF""), KETO, IIFYM, etc. Many approaches work. They are but tools available to you, so find one that best helps you meet your goal. So choose the best ""diet"" or tool that helps you achieve a goal! If that's keto, great! If that's caveman, awesome. I don't care! Limit your calories in whatever ""diet"" you choose and you'll see results.

In my opinion, it's better to make *lifestyle* changes that to follow a diet for a short time. So I don't really like ""diets"" per se, but more so recommend eating like an adult and limiting calories. But even still, different tactics can help in that goal, and you can deploy as many or as few as you want:

* Intermittent Fasting (""IF"")

* Tracking macros / IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros)

* ""Banking"" calories

I don't buy into the other 'benefits' of **IF**, but it was a tactic that worked for me. I am a volume eater. I generally eat well, but I like eating *a lot*. So when I'm cutting, my meals were small and sad. The idea behind IF is that you have a short window of time which you eat meals, the rest of the day you fast. Again, all that matters are calories. You can absolutely get fat eating 10k calories in a 5 hour window. So there's no magic in doing this. But for me, doing IF allowed me to have larger, more satiating meals within the ""eating window"" instead of more, smaller meals.

**Macros** are discussed above, but the idea behind IIFYM is that you've a set # for each macro and, so long as what you're eating fits neatly into the prescribed macro allotment, go for eating whatever you want! And, again, so long as total calories are low enough for you, you will lose weight. But this is /r/BulkorCut, not /r/weightloss. People here are also working out. **How well you workout, recover, perform, feel, etc** is affected by what you eat. So, sure, add in ""fun"" foods sometimes. But don't eat like a child simply because it fit your macros. A safe rule of thumb is to eat ""cleanly"" 80% of the time when bulking, whatever the other 20% of the time. When cutting, I try to eat cleanly 90-95% of the time with fewer treats. What that treat is might change -- some weeks I just want pancakes, other weeks I just want a couple beers. Do what works for you, just do so in controlled quantities.

I liked **""banking"" calories** when I knew I had a special event, date night with the wife, party, or whatever where I'd be consuming extra calories. One way to account for that is to deduct an *additional* amount of calories each day leading up to the event, to then splurge on that event. Example:

Let's say my maintenance is 2,500 calories and I'm eating at a -500 deficit, so I'm eating 2,000 calories daily. I want to take my wife out for our anniversary, so the week leading up to our date night I deduct an additional -250 calories each day and only eat 1,750 calories daily. This gives me 7x250 (=1750) ""banked"" calories I can add to my 2,000 calories on our anniversary. Now I can have a nice dinner, dessert, a drink or two, all without blowing my diet out of whack!

#Body fat % (BF%) estimates

Estimating ones body fat % is kind of hard. We can't see how much fat is stored internally around organs; some people store more fat over the abs, some more around their love handles (that's me!), and others in their legs/ass. So it's really hard to tell. There are various ways to scan BF%, but most are imprecise with a +/- 20% variance. In my opinion, the only thing they're useful for is estimating BF% *changes*. Let's say it reads 20% for you; in six months, you try again and it says 15%. You probably lost around 5% BF%, but your actual BF% might be 12%-18%. So it's not a particularly accurate reading, but the rate change is a useful gauge.

The best ways to learn BF% are via:

* Underwater Weighing (Hydrostatic Weighing) (1-2% variance)

* DEXA scan (1-2% variance)

Everything else has huge variance and is only useful for measuring rate of change.

1,workout,"Beginner's Guide to Working Out  As a personal trainer, I wanted to take the time to answer some of the most frequently asked questions by people who are new to working out. Feel free to let me know if I've missed anything!

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I lose weight?

It’s actually way simpler than you might think: maintain a caloric deficit. Consume fewer calories than you burn. It doesn’t matter of you’re morbidly obese or you’re cutting for a show, this basic principal still applies. Note that eating a healthy diet makes this **far** easier - lots of fruits, veggies, lean protein and water will help you stay satiated for far fewer calories than fatty junk foods (not to mention you’ll have way more energy, and just feel better).

To find out how many calories you should be eating in a day to lose weight, you have a few different options. The first is to determine your maintenance calories with an online calculator, then subtract 250-500 per day from that (to lose about 0.5-1lbs per week). 

The other option (my personal favourite, because everyone is different!) is to start by just honestly tallying up how much you’re currently eating each day. Once that’s determined, start by subtracting 250-500 calories per day. If you haven’t lost any weight in a couple weeks, subtract that amount again, until you start seeing progress.

There’s tons of food tracking apps out there, but I recommend [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) \- it’s free, easy to use, you can scan food labels, and the food database included is enormous.

Another important note - increasing the amount of calories you burn per day (ie. exercising) will also help you stay in a caloric deficit. However, it’s best NOT to rely solely on this method. Doing a whole hour of cardio will only burn a few hundred calories (plus will likely make you hungry for snacks by the time you’re finished) … or, you can simply avoid eating a bag of chips or a piece of pizza, to have the exact same effect. 

That’s not to imply that exercise isn’t important in your weight loss journey - quite the contrary! However, instead of focusing on doing hours of cardio a day, this should only be used to supplement your diet (1-2 hours a week is fine for most people). Your focus should instead be on resistance training. Lifting heavy weights 2-4 times per week plays the important role of ensuring you **maintain your muscle mass as you lose weight.** Want to avoid that “skinny fat” look, and get “toned” instead? Make sure you’re doing resistance training! 

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I lose weight in ___ area?

Unfortunately, spot reduction is a myth. Where you lose weight first (and last) is determined by genetics. However, you \*will\* eventually lose weight in all your problem areas. You just need to be patient, and keep doing what helped you start losing weight in the first place.

 The good news is, the more weight you lose, the more visible the progress will be (especially if you’re doing a good job focusing on just fat loss, while retaining muscle). Going from 250-240lbs probably won’t be noticeable, but losing those last 10lbs will make a huge difference (since a few pounds will make up a far greater percentage of your total body mass). So the progress will be hard-fought for, but definitely worth it! 

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I gain muscle?

It’s a combination of progressively harder resistance training, eating enough food, and lots of patience.

When you’re exercising, just going through the motions isn’t good enough. For optimal muscle gain, you should be performing each set with a weight that you can lift continuously for around 30-60s (this should amount to around 8-15 repetitions). If you feel like you can go for longer, choose a heavier weight. 

Perform each repetition slowly (about 1 second concentric, pause, 2-3 seconds eccentric, pause), through a full range of motion. To clarify - the concentric portion of a lift is when you’re moving against gravity, and the eccentric portion is when you’re moving with gravity. Exercises involving long static holds (like planks) are great for endurance, but they won’t amount to much muscle mass gained.

I cannot overemphasize how important good form is either - for avoiding injury, hardwiring the correct neural pathways, and maximizing muscle gain. Especially when you’re just starting out, choose light weights, and make sure optimal form comes naturally before you start increasing the intensity. It’s way easier learning it correctly the first time than fixing bad habits later.

How much food should you be eating? It varies widely between people. Start with your maintenance calories, add a couple hundred to that (it doesn’t have to be a lot!), and measure your results. Be patient with your progress - men can expect to gain 1-2lbs of lean muscle a month, and 0.5-1lbs for women (beginners may gain a little faster). Eating enough protein is also vital to gaining muscle - a general rule of thumb is around 1 gram of protein (each day) per pound of lean body weight (ie. how much you weigh, minus the amount of fat you have). 

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I get stronger?

It honestly depends on your experience level. If you’re just starting out, doing a normal resistance routine focused on gaining muscle will make you stronger. However, if you’ve been working out regularly for awhile (close to a year), using heavier weights (1-6 reps max) will help you get stronger a lot faster. 

If you’re focusing more purely on strength gain, it’s important that each repetition is done as perfectly as possible (even moreso than for other training goals). That means stopping 1-2 reps shy of failure. Doing just one sloppy rep can severely impact your strength output for the rest of the workout. Don’t be afraid of taking longer rests between sets either (up to 2-3 minutes), as you want to be ready with as much energy as possible before you start your next set. It also goes without saying that heavier weight = greater chance for injury, and proper form will help prevent that.

&amp;#x200B;

### Is it possible to lose fat and build muscle at the same time?

Contrary to popular belief - yes. Especially if you’re a beginner! Just make sure you’re eating around maintenance level calories (along with enough protein), doing resistance training 3-4 times a week, and you’ll start seeing body composition changes. 

However, if you’re significantly over/underweight, or have already been working out for some time, you’ll see much faster progress if you focus on one goal at a time. The main difference here is going to be diet - eating less if you’re trying to lose weight, or eating more if you’re trying to gain weight. Regular resistance training plays a part in both shedding fat and gaining muscle.

&amp;#x200B;

### How should I be structuring my workouts?

For the vast majority of people, full body workouts with compound exercises is the way to go. (For those who don’t know, compound exercises are those which use more than one joint at a time - think squats, bench press, rows, etc.)

The popular back/chest/shoulders/arms/legs split routine (or any variation of it) is good for advanced bodybuilders, but not ideal for beginners. Bodybuilders exercise like this because they need a much greater stimulus to properly stress any given muscle group, and more rest between days training that muscle group as a result of their increased workout intensity.

For a beginner, it’s better to hit each muscle group multiple times a week (this is great to hasten learning and growth). You won’t need as long of a rest period before training the same muscle again, because it won’t be as fatigued after each workout.

Compound exercises give you the greatest bang for your buck because you’re working out so many muscles in one movement (and burning way more calories at the same time). Isolation exercises (those working one joint at a time, like bicep curls or leg extensions) are best for bodybuilders who really need to hone in on a single muscle.

Doing resistance training 3-4 times a week is a good goal to shoot for. Workouts should be around 45-60 minutes, with around 6-8 exercises done during that time. Try to keep rests between sets to around 60s (this is all very generalized, and can change depending on experience level and goal). Space rest days evenly between workouts if you can.

Start your workouts with the exercises which require the most energy (usually those which involve lifting the most weight), saving any isolation/ab exercises for the end.

If you’d like some help planning your workout routine, I just released a fitness app called [PerfectFit](https://www.perfect-fit.app/). It gives you access to workouts designed by a personal trainer, all customized according to your unique goals, fitness level, and available equipment. There are tons of bodyweight exercises included - ideal for anyone working out at home! The app is currently available to download on Android, and iOS is hopefully just a few days away (currently under review).

&amp;#x200B;

### What should I be eating?

If your goal is a change in body composition (gaining muscle/losing fat), the amount of calories you’re consuming is the most important thing to pay attention to.

If you’re consistently working out hard but failing to gain/lose weight, chances are you need to make alterations to your diet. For weight loss, that usually means eating at a deficit of 250-500 calories per day; for weight gain, eating at a surplus of 200-300 calories per day.

What exact foods you’re eating has an impact on how easily you can stick to your calorie goals, as well as your energy levels.

Consuming around 1 gram of protein per pound of lean bodyweight (per day) is a given, regardless of what your fitness goal is. This helps to maintain satiety, and preserve/increase muscle mass.

Eating lots of fruits and veggies (as well as drinking 2-3L of water a day - more for some people) is a great way to feel full without consuming too many calories. It also just contributes to all-around health and energy levels.

Eating lots of fatty foods should be avoided if weight loss is the goal - not because fat makes you fat per se, but because they are so calorically dense. Only one tablespoon of peanut butter or olive oil is 100 calories! Conversely, if your goal is to **gain** weight, adding more fatty foods to your diet (healthy fats, if possible) can help you hit that calorie goal easier.

And carbs? Not as evil as people make them out to be. Think of them as the energy that fuels your brain and your workouts. Having around 50% of your calories coming from carbs is about the norm. It’s likely beneficial to raise this number even higher if you’re an especially lean individual, or you’re regularly working out at intense levels.

&amp;#x200B;

### When should I be eating?

The easiest way to time your meals properly is to think: “What will I be doing in the next 2-3 hours?” Eat according to the activity you’re about to do. That doesn’t mean you should be having a giant meal right before your workout, but ideally your biggest meal of the day would be several hours before you exercise. This will give you the energy you need, plus ensure the calories you consume are shuttled into your muscles instead of fat reserves.

If you’re about to do an intense workout, the best thing to eat beforehand (around 15-30 minutes prior) is a light snack of healthy carbs (like some fruit). For optimal recovery, aim for 20-30g of protein within an hour after you workout (if you miss this window though don’t worry about it). A protein shake is probably the simplest and most convenient way of doing this, but whole food is just as good.

&amp;#x200B;

### What supplements should I be taking?

If you have a healthy, well-rounded diet, including 2-3 cups of different veggies each day,  enough protein per pound of bodyweight (from sources that include sufficient amounts of each essential amino acid), and adequate omega-3 fatty acids - then you’re golden, and probably don’t need any supplements.

However, the vast majority of the population would probably benefit from a simple multivitamin and omega-3 supplement, just to help fill any nutritional gaps they have.

If you’re getting enough protein from whole food, then you probably don’t need to add protein powder. However, if you’re struggling with this, then protein powder is a great way to easily increase your daily protein intake. Whey protein is the most bioavailable and has a complete amino acid profile, so it’s the best choice for most people. However, if you’re vegan (or lactose intolerant), there are lots of plant proteins available. You just need to pay attention to the amino acid profile of each one (possibly mixing and matching different plant sources if you need to).

As for all the other supplements out there, it’s honestly on a case-by-case basis as to whether they’d actually help you or not. If you’re a beginner, unless you have any specific requirements or deficits, you probably don’t need them.

&amp;#x200B;

### Is stretching important?

Yes. Please stretch (or do some other form of myofascial release, such as foam rolling), or you’ll eventually regret it. Regular exercise makes your muscles slowly form clumps of tissue and fascia. Neglecting to release these can result in restricted range of motion, and eventually pain.

Static stretching should be done at the **end** of your workout. Aim to stretch each worked muscle near its end range of motion for around 60s total. Don’t stretch before your workout, as this can impede strength output.

&amp;#x200B;

### Is warming up important?

Yes. Warming up is paramount to increasing blood flow and activating your muscles properly before you move onto more intense, metabolically demanding exercises. 

Ideally, during your warm-up, you should be actively moving your muscles through the same ranges of motion you’ll be doing for your workout. This can be as simple as doing the exact same movement, but with minimal weight - for example, doing a few sets of bodyweight squats before doing barbell squats.

You want your warm-ups to elevate your heart rate, but not be so intense that they start tiring you out and detract from your workout. Usually 5-10 minutes of light activity is enough."

They're both pretty simmilar, exept Jeremy has a few excercises that I think are more preferable. I think both routines are great, but I wanted to make one that took the best out of both of them. That's why I made a new plan that I think looks quite promising.

**I was hoping if anyone could help me make sure all of the excersizes are in the correct order?** The idea is to complete the most taxing workouts first, and then make your way down. 

Another thing I dislike about Jeff's routine is his sets and reps. Most of the excersizes have a 3x5 structure, when according to this site  [https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-many-reps-should-you-do.html](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-many-reps-should-you-do.html) the best rep range is between 8-12 reps for maximum muscle hypertrophy. That's why i'm thinking of applying 3x10 or 4x10 sets and reps to all of the workouts.

Any comments or recomendations would be apreciated."
7,workout,"Workout to lose gut/gain muscle Hello, I am a 5’8 155lb male looking to lose some weight in my stomach and gain some muscle. I don’t drink alcohol and eat relatively healthy (downfall is portion control). I am looking for help/program/suggestions on how to achieve this at home  I have an elliptical, Bodley machine, adjustable dumbbells, heavy bag and speed bag. I go to workout but don’t have a set routine. Please let me know how I can best utilize this equipment to help me achieve my goals. Thank you!"
8,workout,"My shoulders/neck are always so tense I feel like no matter what I do I put a lot of pressure on my shoulders and neck and rely on their strenght mostly. Especially during push ups.

And I suffer from shoulder/neck pain. It has come to a point that I am considering just stop working out, because this neck pain really makes me uncomfortable and even interferes with my personal life.

I tried giving a break and skipped a few exercises, and the pain was gone, but when I started again it immediately come back.

What should I do? I am not even working out that hard, just exercising in my home doing 4 sets of push ups, crunches, and lift some dumbbells. My goal is not having a nice body or being really strong - but rather having an ok body and strong enough for my body."
9,workout,"Struggling to workout due to depression? I never thought I would have to post this, but here we go. I’ve been a huge workout buff for years now. Started running when I was 8, started lifting when I was 15, and I’ve been working out consistently since then until now, at the age of 18. I also have had severe depression since about the age of 7, and I’ve learned how to push through it. I’ve learned how to clear my head and force myself to work out, even when I go weeks where I just so desperately want to lay on the floor in a ball and die. And now I’m starting to have trouble pushing through it, and I’m not sure what to do. I’ve been on a few different medicines and the one I’m on now works well, but stuff is starting to slip through again. Another little background context is ive also suffered from an eating disorder for years. It’s gotten a lot better and I’m finally mostly eating normally, but my background means that my body doesn’t show I’ve been working out for years. The result of all this is that I have a huge desire to workout, but no motivation and I’m starting to struggle with pushing through my mental fog. I apologize for how long this is, and hopefully someone here understands and has gone through the same thing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I’m a 20yo 145lb male, around 5’11-6’. I’ve had a lengthy/skinny build my whole life, and always been a little underweight at least for my liking. I suppose my metabolism is pretty fast bc no matter how many calories I eat, I never seem to get any heavier. Towards the beginning of quarantine (March/April) I gained about 10 lbs (155 then) bc I was smoking alot more in my free time and eating alot more bc of munchies. That was the heaviest I had ever been in my life, but it wasn’t how I wanted to gain weight. I started working a new job and playing tennis for ~2 hours a day, and in like 2 weeks all that weight was gone again. Now im back down to 145ish and with the new school year starting I want to start eating better + gaining weight the right way. I know bc of my natural build i’ll never look like some bodybuilder or anything but I wanna gain some weight via muscle.

28,workout,"Ways to balance muscle size? Hi all, for those who have seen my last post here, I have been working hard to make gains and obtain muscle mass. After a few months of challenging myself to do more push ups and bicep/tricep exercises, I've noticed that my chest has expanded a little bit (which is good progress), but my left pec/side of my chest is a little bigger than my right. While it doesn't bother me too much, I'm a little concerned about it. Have I been doing something wrong? Is there a way to fix this? Another concern I have is my arms. Since my right arm is dominant, it's always been a little larger in size than my left arm. Once again, it doesn't bother me to the point where I'm annoyed, but I'd like to balance this out. 

The exercises I do for chest are: Regular Push ups, Chest Press Machine, Incline and Decline Pushups

The exercises I do for biceps/triceps are: Hammer Curls, Concentration Curls, Standing Dumbbell Curl, Zottoman Curl

So, I'm reaching out today to see if you guys have any suggestions as to how I can balance this out and make these muscles more proportionate in size. You can also read my previous post to see how my progress and for some context on how I'm doing. Keep in mind, I DO NOT have access to any indoor gym (although gyms are scheduled to open on Sep. 2 in NYC). The only gym I go to is a small outdoor one that has a pull up bar, chest press machine, and some bicycle machines. Also keep in mind that the only equipment I have is a 12 pound dumbbell. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. :)"

49,workout,"Home Workout: Apps vs AI Mirrors Hi all, I am wanting to get back into exercising and could really use some guidance.

 For background, prior to covid I was seeing a trainer once a week for a little over a year and going to the gym 1-3 times a week outside of that session. I liked having the discipline and accountability of having a trainer, even if I wasn't feeling great (usually mentally) it still made me show up.

Now with covid, I've fallen out of a routine and into a bit of depression. I tried going to zoom work outs that my trainer was hosting but the timing was hard and I lost motivation after a couple months. My gym is allowing members to go in for training only and I'm honestly not comfortable doing so. I really liked my trainer but based on theirs and another trainers social medias I don't feel they're being safe.

Working out typically puts me in a good mood and helps me manage anxiety and depression. I just feel overwhelmed right now and don't know where to restart.

I was wondering if there are apps that you would recommend for a good workout but also have some level of motivation and accountability built into it? (May be asking for too much?) 

Alternatively, I recently came across the Tempo Home Gym. It's pretty expensive and has a monthly membership on top of it but I like the AI integration and that is corrects your form and makes recommendations. Has anyone purchased this or have thoughts around it?

Between gym membership and training, I was spending about $200 a month. My work also offers a $500 health and wellness stipend each year. So out of pocket I was investing about $1900 a year in to my health and fitness, I would like to not spend more than that unless it's some miracle app or machine but ideally saving a little money would be best.

Apologies for such a long post, I am just hoping to find a little guidance after drowning in Google searches and being discouraged for the past couple months. Thank you as well for any help."

I hadn't really noticed until one day i stepped on the scale and weighed 197 lbs on july 24. as I've always been fit this came to a large surprise to me so i decided i needed to get back on track.

I eat \~1500 calories a day, late breakfast i have 1 cup of egg whites, with a less than a teaspoon of avacado oil and maybe a quarter cup of cheese-- less than 300 calories. for lunch i have a protein shake and milk, syntha 6 140 calories + milk 130--270 calories. For dinner it fluctuates of course but i'm usually sitting at about 600-700 calories. then i have another protein shake late at night +270 all in all about 1500 calories.

Need help with nutrition Hello, so during the start of quarantine i decided to start to working out. At first it was not like fully enforced, I still ate whatever I wanted, and it wasn’t so strict. In may, I started going on daily bike rides in the morning, around 10km a day or so, as well as working out at night. These workouts were just on the nike app, but not hard workouts. In June I decided to start chloe ting workouts, I did her 25 day hourglass program, lean arms program, 2 week abs program, and 5 week booty challenge. At that time I started to monitor what I ate, and definitely didn’t eat as much junk as I used to. halfway through the 5 week booty challenge I decided to switch to the nike app and start a plan. These workouts were definitely harder and I feel good after, but I need some advice! It’s been around 5 months, but the change to my body isn’t how i wanted to be. I’m 114 pounds with a 25.5 inch waist and 34 inch hips. I think when I started I was around 26 inch waist. I was aiming for a leaner body and some subtle abs, but unless I flex really hard there’s only a thin line down the middle of my body. There is also still some fat covering my abs. I also wanted to target my armpit fat and arms, but nothing changed. I started to think it was about my diet. My diet right now is complicated. My family says I don’t eat enough but I’m not purposely trying to. However in the morning I usually just eat a couple of snacks and fruit and I’m done until lunch. Is not eating enough the reason I’m not getting the results I want? What should I eat? How much calories should I be eating per day? Where can I find recipes? I’m kind of good at cooking but I don’t know where to start or what to make. I really really need some advice because I’ve been working out for so long but not getting the results I’ve wanted, and I feel frustrated."

I also have the biggest baby face so if someone could help me that would be great. But one of my greatest concerns is that no much how I workout, my abs are never defined. They don’t even show unless I flex super hard. I’m sort of leaning towards an lean toned hourglass figure as my goal, but I don’t know what to do.

75,workout,"Help with starting bodyweight workout I want to workout again, but with my bodyweight only. This is my workout for abs, back, and biceps:

- Warming up with planks
- Sit ups
- Back (I don't know what this is called in English, but you lay on your stomach, put your hands up to your head, lift your head, then chest, and then down again)
- Australian pull ups

What do you think? Is there something I can add, should remove or replace etc for a better abs, back, biceps day? Keep in mind that I'm new at it, and that's why I'm doing Australian pull ups as I can't do full pull ups yet.

And how many times a week should I do it maximum to avoid injuries? It is only bodyweight though."

I have a bit larger... ‘soft’ thighs(more inner thigh than outer). And I want to tone them SO BADLY as well as tone my calves. 

Has anyone had experience with leg exercises that worked at home? Can I get some tips? 

Also, do you eat before or after workout? And how do protein shakes work? And is meal timing important? 

It’s kind of overwhelming sometimes..

90,workout,"I’m looking for any workouts or exercises to ease back into full workouts after knee injury. Hello all! Around October of last year I began my weight loss journey. Well, tried anyway. I was eating right and started getting into weight training. I would workout about 4 times a week. Beginning of this year I was running everyday and in February began CrossFit. That didn’t last very long because about a month later is when COVID came around and during that time I also suffered a bad knee injury (both knees but one way worse than the other) from a fall I had. That’s when I stopped working out and the diet eventually went out the window as well. A few of weeks ago, I got back into my healthy diet routine and I would like to start easing back in to working out. My knee is still healing, sometimes I still feel little aches and pains, but it feels stronger everyday. It’s definitely not what it used to be though, not yet anyway, so I don’t expect to go back at it full force anytime soon. 

At home I have light dumbbells, a stationary bike and a treadmill that I plan on starting slow on but I was wondering if there was anything else I could do. Maybe at home body weight exercises? I guess I could go to google but I feel like reddit would understand my situation better. It’s just hard because I’m the type of person that likes to sweat and push myself so I hate being limited."
91,workout,"Workout App Idea So you know how some people kinda get motivated when they curse/get cursed at? Like, idk about other people, but I curse myself out a lot during my workouts, and it motivates me to keep going, especially when I'm pushing my limits like going for a new planking record or something like that. While I was taking my regular shower after my last workout, I had an idea. What if you made an interactive workout app based on how much you get cursed out. You can choose your routines not based on the intensity of the workout (although you could definitely change that too, the same workout doesn't always fit everyone) but you choose based on how much the trainer curses at you. Like, there would be pre-recorded videos of a trainer doing the workouts with you, and you pick what you want based on the intensity or the way they curse at you. And like there would be different tiers of cursing, maybe along the lines of the ones I came up with here

PC (Politically Correct): absolutely no cursing, name-calling, etc.

Schoolyard Bully: Minor curses and name-calling

Insulting: average amount of cursing

Drill Sergeant: Get cursed out heavy and often

Masochist: The most degrading and insulting workout tier

How can I actually tho lose fat when I am never in a caloric deficit?

Since now it’s my off-season, i’m trying to bulk; I’m eating in a calorie surplus and using myfitnesspal to track cal and macros; and i’m eating extremely clean. i’m in the gym 6 days a week (push/pull/legs) and 1-2 on the ice a week. I have been getting atleast 8 hours of sleep a night. 

When i took the scan today it said i’m 181lbs and 14.5% body fat. i don’t get how that’s possible. i’ve been working so hard at the gym. It’s really disappointing  and upsetting.

122,workout,"Workout routine for a 16 year old working out alone So I worked out at the gym for a while, but then corona came. The gym recently opened again, and I'm looking for a new workout routine that I could use.  
There are so many different routines out there, so I've never really been sure what to choose between, and due to the fact that I'm 16 there is a chance I shouldn't do certain exercises. I have heard from certain people that I shouldn't do deadlifts for example (fact check me if that's wrong). 

Anyways, I'm also working out alone, so I've been staying away from things like barbell bench press due to the fact that I'm working out alone, and don't wanna fail while alone.

I don't have much experience with leg workouts either, as I was slacking on that when I used to work out, but I'm definitely going to start doing that more now. Any tips would be appreciated, thanks!"
123,workout,"Here's what I want, here's what I'm doing, help me establish some goals I'm 20yo, male, 5'6, and currently weight just about 200lbs naked. But all of that weight is in my belly and upper legs.

I've never desired to be thin, even when I was I didn't really pay it much mind. I've always said if I had to choose between my weight and my strength, I'd choose strength every time. Back when I was in highschool, I did some powerlifting and got *denser* and I loved it. Didn't gain any height but put on about 20-25lbs of muscle in 6 months. My shoulders/pecks filled out and my trunk became unstoppable. I was dead lifting twice a week, benching my own body weight, rock climbing, etc.

Well, fast forward 2-3 years and now I'm not strong I'm just fat. When I graduated highschool I stopped lifting and despite my attempts to maintain a gym schedule over the summer and then at college, I just couldn't do it without the structure of highschool. I also went on some medication for all of a few months but managed to put about 40lbs onto my gut due to it and that has never gone away.

with this pandemic I've actually *increased* my exercise by introducing some equipmentless stuff into my daily routine: pushups, planks, and squats. But my efforts have been frequently de-railed by trips out of town, injuries (not workout related), and my bad sleep schedule. My goal once my most recent wound heals is to rotate squats --&gt; planks --&gt; pushups in a 3 day cycle, doing each exercise throughout the day for the whole day.

---

I strive to eat healthy and by a lot of accounts I do. I don't eat a lot of junky food like hot dogs, pizza, microwavable meals, and I don't consume a lot of gluten. I also don't drink any sugar, just unsweetened green tea by the quart, and water if I don't have that. I can't recall the last time I've bought soda or fruit juice. I cook a lot, especially now during the pandemic. Rice, potatoes, roasted/stir-fried veggies, fresh corn. Primary meats are chicken, salmon, and lamb in that order. My snacks are stuff like peanut butter, cheese, lunch meats, varieties of chips/crackers.

My biggest struggles diet wise are A) eating big and staying full. I'm constantly grazing on stuff I can eat quickly and easily. I've combated this by maintaining a fasting period (14-16 hours most days) recently, and just allotting more effort into cooking. But even when I cook a big meal I struggle to eat the protein and vacuum up the carb instead. and B) leafy greens. I hate salads and don't like any plain leafy green like spinach, lettuce, or kale. I'll cook with cabbage but that has the nutritional value of paper and is just a filler for stir fries. Actually, when I said I don't like spinach that's was a lie. fully mature, fresh spinach I'll eat with the silt on right out of the ground. But that baby stuff that's already multiple days old and was harvested before it was ready that they have in the super market is terrible.

---

With all of that in mind, what I want is simple: weight numbers and endurance. I want to be able to get through a day of hard labor. I want to be able to lift a heavy object off of the ground, or push something heavy across the room. I don't really care what I look like, up to and including the world's largest beer gut. I don't really care if my BMI labels me overweight. I truly couldn't care less about having a six pack. As long as there's muscle I can use on my bones I'll be a happy man."

I  want to somehow try harder exercises..obviously me being at home means I  can't do weights and my place is a red zone so quarantined..but I feel  like my body has adjusted to this and I wanted to try a more challenging  exercises,

Especially , I don't even feel squats anymore....I've been doing it everyday and now I don't feel strained after doing it..

so  i come to the people of reddit...I really didn't know which subreddit  to post this in...is there a routine I can follow that's a little more  advanced but nothing too complicated as I literally cannot afford to be  injured now.....I've lost a considerable amount of weight...about total  20 kgs in the few months...I'm controlling what I eat and trying to have  more protein...I can only probably dedicate max 2hrs a day to it since I  have online classes too.I want to  tone my body and build my muscles as  much as I can from my home...( a little personal side note...I started  working out after a long relationship  ended in midst of my depression  and it has helped me come a long way but I want to get even more into  shape so that when I get back to college I can have something to show  for you know) maybe my reasons are shallow but I really want to get into  shape.. any advice would be appreciated."

132,workout,"Routine Improvement  Hello, so, I'm a 25yo male, 170cm tall, currently at 73kg, looking to cut down to 65kg before starting to bulk

What I've been doing recently, at home is: **pushups**, **situps**, **dumbbell curls**, **squats** and whatever comes to mind on a given day and I'll do this **3 days in a row, the 4th day I'll do boxing for cardio, 5th day rest**, rinse and repeat.

Now, doing only these exercises is wrong, that I know, but I can easily do different ones, as I've done a lot of different exercises in the past, **the THING that's bugging me**, is the schedule itself, because all around me, most people I know, won't work the same body parts days in a row. They'll do **chest day, legs day, core day,** whatever.

**TLDR**: I'd like to switch from doing whole body workouts 3 days in a row, to working on specific body parts if that is better, can you guys give me a little help? Like, how should I split it? Is 3 days muscles, 1 cardio, 1 rest, good? Would Chest/Shoulders &gt; Biceps/Triceps &gt; Legs &gt; Cardio &gt; Rest be good? Or at least better than doing whole body days in a row?

Also, after my rest day, should I start with cardio? Or leave cardio to the end as I do right now?"

Ok, so I'm 17, and I'm a bit overweight. I started going to the gym last year, and got a lot of progress down, to the point where I lost some weight and even gained some muscle. The issue now is that after COVID struck, I haven't been going with my workout as full-fledged as I did before. For the first month or so, I kept going with a lower intensity workout, and a week or so later, I stopped completely. It was first just one day, then it became 2 days and then the next thing I know, I've gained almost half the weight I've lost back. I'm not able to find a workout that keeps me doing it every day and still helping me in the long run. I need to lose weight, mainly because I want to be a pilot, and a pilot needs to have a maximum BMI of 26. I think currently I'm at around a 27.2 or so, and I SERIOUSLY need some guidance, ILL TAKE ANY SUGGESTIONS."
135,workout,"Do Bodyweight exercises cause oblique growth? Hi!

I have been following workout routine from youtube 5 times a week (10-15min everytime) for a few months now to get a smaller waist, I dont use any weights other than just my body however I have been reading recently that these exercises can cause your obliques to grow, thus increasing the size of your waist. Im a bit skeptical to whether or not the exercises could do much difference alone without weights, I personally cant tell if my obliques have grown cause I have lost weight in the process. So my question is, could doing these exercises regularly cause an increase in oblique size therefore, waist even if a little bit?

Thank youu!!

141,workout,"Post run nausea This morning I went for my first run in 3 weeks. I do intermediate walk/run with a 30 second sprint at the end. (My goal is to be able to run for a full 30 minutes by the end of the year)

I took some time off because band camp started and I didn't want to do a work out then go and march for 8 hours. Anyways, band camp is over and I'm getting back into my old schedule.

After my run I felt very nauseous. I first thought it was because I had a glass of water before I left for my run, but looking back I figured out pretty quickly that I was dehydrated. So far I've drank about 6 cups of water to at least replenish myself and I still feel nauseous. (Granted I had a small thing of fries because I was starving after my shift went through lunchtime)

How long does post run nausea last? Should I go for a run again tomorrow morning even if I'm feeling better? And what should I be eating/drinking to avoid future nausea?

Update: I took someone's advice and ate a banana before going for my morning run. Halfway through my run my stomach started to cramp and I had to slow to a walk or else the pain would get worse. I drank a protein shake after the pain subsided and took a shower. I don't feel nauseous in the slightest. I understand that as a first time runner this is the period where I figure out what works for me and how I can adjust my intake and workout schedules so I don't have any issues in the future. For tomorrow I'm going to get my cups of water today, and then go for a run tomorrow before eating or drinking anything."

Then work out around 12 would the caffeine in the coffee negatively affect me when it comes to the workout later?

My diet has been relatively clean and try to stay at a deficit in order to lose weight. I'll have my first meal at noon, usually oatmeal or peanut butter toast. My dinner will usually be some protein and light carbs.

My question is regarding my workout schedule. With my work schedule I usually only have time to hit the gym after 4:30 PM. So I'll hit the gym with my weight workout and eat dinner right after and usually finish eating dinner around 7 PM and done eating for the day.

153,workout,"How can I lose fat in... My face/my thighs/wherever else I keep seeing this question popping up. 
Spot reduction isn't a thing, there is no way to miraculously get rid of the fat in your arms or wherever else. Fat in your body will be distributed however your body does it, it's usually genetic. If you want to lose fat in a certain part of your body you need to be in a caloric deficit and see where the fat disappears. It may not be in the place you hoped it was going to happen but there's nothing you can do about that.
If you want to spot reduce you have to lose fat all around."

I was good at getting in the gym when the gym was open, but It takes a lot for me to gain weight off of working out alone. It's eating more that is truly the challenging part for me. Especially because I never had actual meal plans or workout routines. I used to get assistance from Golds Gym for nutritional tips and workouts, but it's very expensive so I don't have those resources anymore. I also used to be in a meal plan that makes your weekly meals for you, but it was also very expensive. Now I want to try and have my own workout routine and a good meal plan in order to gain weight, but I know nothing about either. Can anyone assist me with their personal meal prep and work out schedule? Or any resources I can use that are free? I tried doing this off of research but just got overwhelmed. There are so many different aspects that go into working out as well as meals and the people who share this information online were either trying to lose weight or were already an average weight and just wanted to get bigger.

I am a 28 year old male at 90kg and looking to lose 15kg by best case December 2020 (posting this on 23 August 2020). The only home equipment I have available are
2 x 15kg dumbbells
Spinbike
Yoga mat

The workout I want to do looks like the following:

Dumbbell curls - 5 sets of 12-20 reps 

Seated overhead tricep extension - 5 sets of 12-20 reps

Hammer curls - 5 sets of 12-20 reps 

Standing shoulder press - 5 sets of 12-20 reps

Lying dumbbell press - 5 sets of 12-20 reps

Dumbbell squats - 5 sets of 20+ reps


All of the above exercises are performed at 10kg but will move to maximum 15kg after a few weeks. I don't plan on buying more weights so I'm going to opt for more reps per set instead (should I be doing more reps than I indicated in my routine above?)
I want to perform this routine 3x per week with occasionally swapping one out for a HIIT routine on the spin bike. 

Does this sound like a realistic routine for building muscle and burning fat? Assuming I am meeting my daily protein and calorie requirements.

Been doing a made up workout this whole time, my progress has been good but I’m aware I’m doing a rubbish workout. I do 10x15 sets of butterfly kicks, 10x50 sets crunches, 5x25 dumbbell squats, 5x50 squats, 15x15 sets of 5KG dumbbell curls and 5x20 kettlebell swings. I do 4 days on one day off repeat, but again that’s annoying because it doesn’t fit into a week.

Started doing some Nike training workouts instead, did a 20 min tank top arms workout, which was really good I felt the burn and pushed myself. But I can’t find a good ab workout where I’m actually feeling the burn in my abs in the same way, my form is slightly off on new workouts and I’m worried my progress will go backwards, does anyone have any recommendations on a hard hitting ab workout?

Hey Everybody. Hope you are all staying safe out there.

I am starting to get back into routinely working out. Little info about me. I'm 5'11. 150 pounds. stick-figured. I've played soccer my whole life. I'm 27 and still play twice a week. I suffer a lot from depression so I've formed a lot of bad habits throughout the years. I hired a new trainer that I know will do a good job pushing me. He's a personal friend and well known around the area so I have the motivation to keep this going. One of those bad habits is due to long hours, I would work 12+ hours and only have the chance to eat one big meal a day and then a few small snacks. I've been like that for a while now. I know it's bad lol. I usually eat very unhealthily too which I know doesn't help. I know due to eating once/twice a day I am usually never feeling hungry so it's very hard to force myself to eat at times like that. If I do eat when I'm not hungry, it has to be something small so I don't feel sicker. I usually just wait until I get that big hunger feeling later on in the day. My two goals are to obviously create a way better diet and get back on the path of eating correctly. The other goal is I want to gain muscle. I don't want to get swoll and jacked, but I want to have some noticeable muscles. I don't want the sticks anymore lol. I want my ex to get mad haha. My workout routine will be training with him for 2 days, 2 days playing soccer. 1 day at the personal gym.

With all of that being said, I do plan on obviously making some big diet changes, I want to start eating more and get back into the normal eating routines. I want to eat healthier and all of that. What is the best way to go about that? How do I slowly start to eat more? I know the main thing is to eat more and more small things until you start building up an appetite but should I look into meal replacements to help guide me? I am not looking to replace any meals, I just want to make sure I am getting what my body needs in order to ensure that my workout is actually helping my body and I'm getting bigger. I plan on making whole foods each day now. I am just curious as to maybe for the start, a replacement meal + whole foods would be a good way to start achieving that first goal? Then once I start eating more and more I can start to take off the replacement shakes and then rely on whole foods. Because of my bad habits, I would really prefer not to do replacement shakes as to the fear I might go to them a little too much. I am not against using them though a short time if it will be beneficial to my workout and diet change. I plan on tracking what I eat for the most part. I'm not going to go crazy but I'll record most things. 

I do plan on doing post-workout shakes too! Phormula-1 and Ignition are the two that I have. I am also throwing in some Creatine as well. Any helpful information would be awesome! I'm a beginner when it comes to the gym so please go easy! I'm also pretty picky when it comes to food so any flavor recommendations on anything would be awesome. I'm also not trying to break the bank too. I know a lot of products out there are very expensive. I would like to stick with just post-workout shakes if I can.

&amp;#x200B;

Push:

\-Bench press 5 x 8, I feel as if I should definitely change up my sets and reps for this exercise but not sure

\-DB bench press/ incline db press 4 x 12,

\-Shoulder press/ Arnold shoulder press 4 x 12

\-side raises 4 x 15 with lighter weight, could use a better second shoulder exercise

\-overhead tricep extensions 4 x 12, I struggle with tricep exercises with db's so hoping to find some replacements

&amp;#x200B;

Pull:

\-Pull ups / chin ups 3 x 8

\-barbell row 4 x 12

\-barbell curl 4 x 8

\-hammer curl / concentration curl 4 x 12

\-shrugs 4 x 12, I have trouble with this exercise and feel like I dont work these muscles very well

&amp;#x200B;

Legs:

\-DB squat 4 x 15, didn't have enough weight so had to do more reps, plan on switching to proper squat rack

\-RDL 4 x 12

\-lunges/bulgarian split squat 4 x 12

\-stair calf raises 4 x 15

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I wanted to ask about my sets and reps, I sometimes feel as if it would be more optimal to use more weight and stick around the 8-10 rep range, also wondering if 4 sets if optimal or if id be better of doing 3 or 5. Also as I pointed out earlier I feel like I need to change both my reps and sets for bench press but could be wrong. My goals are to build muscle and strength.

I just decided to start taking care of my body. My first goal is to create a habit. So I took a look around the house, found some stuff, and created a routine based on what was available.

Right now I'm doing the following, six days a week:  


* 5x100 skipping rope
* 5x10 body weight exercises (rotate between push-ups, burpees, sit-ups etc)
* 5x15 exercises with a 12 kg kettlebell (soon moving up to 16 kg)

I'm 178 cm / 75 kg and I've done this for some time now. I \_feel\_ great. My question is, does this workout affect my body at all?

I really like that it is so accessible. I can just take a brisk walk around the neighborhood and then do the entire routine on my lawn. But I guess I have to, at some point in time, start going to the gym.

I understand that it is very hard to give an answer, but I want to know if a routine like this does anything at all to a normal body (e.g. not overweight or anything).

Thanks and sorry for the stupid question :-)"

277,workout,"Life hack: get your daily dose of protein without consuming a single calorie! Diet pepsi has 0.1g of protein per 355ml. A 2L bottle then has 0.56g of protein, and 0 calories! (OK technically 1g of protein is 4 calories but thats negligible here so). To figure out how many bottles you need to drink to achieve your protein goals, divide your daily protein (in grams) by 0.56.

I personally aim for around 180g of protein a day. Therefore 180/0.56 = 321.428... round that up to 322 (extra protein never hurts!). 

There you have it! I need to drink 322 bottles of 2L pepsi a day to achieve my protein goals, and not consume a SINGLE calorie! Now I can spend my daily calories on junk food like donuts, pizza, ice cream without sacrificing on my gains!!

i want to get a better overview about my data. Hope you can help with it.

So i am wearing a Samsung Gear fit 2. It is paired with my Samsung S20 phone.  
I got the strava app on the Gear fit and on the phone. It syncs the runs very well from the Gear fit to my strava.

But i also want to look at my steps, pulse etc. Now i can only see in in the gear fit, which isn´t very comfortable and in the Samsung Health app.

And i got a scale / body analyzer thingy from withings. They use an app called ""Health Mate"". It protocols my weight and body fat. But i dont find an option to sync it with Samsung Health..

For lifting i use an app called progression. This app can only sync to google fit i think.

Is there any chance i get all those data together on one nice site / app? Can you recommend on?  
google fit? Samsung health? 

I haven´t looked into google fit, bc i am already pretty confused at this point and i am sure you guys can recommend be the right tool, before i lose my mind. Btw i dont care much about the privacy of my data at this point.

The number of reps seems very high for a beginner. But, this routine, seems to lack back muscles workout in my opinion. I like the aspect of daily training, it creates a habit, a system in life. I am in favour of daily full body workouts rather than 3 times a week grinding to near death.

Anyone has experience with these sort of daily full body workouts which make you strong and flexible and don't take up a huge chunk of your day? I know there are routines out there from multiple sources each claiming to be the best. I don't want to buy into those. I want to hear from real experiences and their routines.

Edit 1: BTW, by strong and flexible I mean functionally strong and flexible with healthy joints. So I am mainly looking for people with calisthenics experiences.

I know, I'm skinny for someone of my height and weight, so I've been trying to gain muscle mass this whole year. Unfortunately, due to COVID 19, my local gym is closed, forcing me to workout at home with no equipment, except for a 12 lb dumbbell and a pair of hand grips. However, there is an outdoor gym in my city that I go to that has a pull bar and a machine that targets the biceps.

Each day is reserved for working out a different part of my body, in this order: Biceps, Triceps, Chest, Abs, Legs. For each exercise I do, I do 5 sets of 20 reps, 4 sets of 25 reps, 3 sets of 30 reps, 2 sets of 35 reps, and 1 set of 40 reps. The specific exercises are as follows:

Biceps: Hammer Curls, Concentration Curls, Standing Dumbbell Curl, Zottoman Curl

Triceps: Bench Dips, Pull Ups

Chest: I start by doing 10 regular pushups, then 10 decline push ups. Then I do 9 of each, then 8, and so on until I reach 1, equaling to 110 push ups overall. After that, I do regular pushups with the standard routine (5 sets of 20, 4 sets of 25, so on).

Abs: Regular Sit Ups, Bicycle Crunches, Dumbbell Twist (same idea as Medicine Ball Twist, but with my dumbbell instead)

Legs: Bulgarian Split Squats, Regular Squats

As for diet, I've been trying to eat a lot of foods rich with protein, which includes eggs, chicken, rice, and lasagna. I also mix some Muscle Milk protein powder with my juice/milk after each workout. While I have been showing some considerable gains, particularly my chest since it has expanded, I'm still quite skinny and not making as much gains as I would like. So, I'm reaching out today for advice on how to make gains. Any advice on what I should start/stop doing, as well as any new exercises I should start doing would be greatly appreciated. :)"

Before I start read all, there may be a detail here that will solve my question, without me knowing. 

Im 18 years old and weigh 77.1 kg. I have been running for two years now. I love it a lot but I want to grow upperbody muscle. 

I start with running my usual 5 km or 3km run (depends on what day it is) and then I stretch. Pretty basic. 5 days a week. 

Everytime I have started to workout my upper body, I have seen no results. Two times I workouted for 6 weeks, with little to no result. 

I am tired and feel demotiveted to start again. 

My main goal is visual abs and bigger arms. But in general upperbody

So here is my first question: Has my running ruined my progress?

If so, is there any product I can take that makes sure that I don’t burn muscle? 

Should I try Protein powder or any other products? 

How long should a muscle workout last? I often get tired early. 

Any workoutroutine that fits me? 

I can exstend my workout to 2 hours, if needed. But as I said earlier, I get tired early from muscle workouts."

I am a 17-years-old male, who has been working out for five months. Every day I do 7x20 push-ups, 5x80 sit-ups, 3x70 squats. 

I am a vegan and eat healthy, I try to include as much natural protein as possible. I do not take any supplements, nor do I want to. 

In these five months I have gained some muscle, but I was expecting to gain more. I know that building your body takes years and decades, but I just seem to gain way too little muscle, so I want to ask IS IT BECAUSE I WORK OUT EVERY SINGLE DAY? I know, that muscles need to recover and one should have a rest day, but I don't think I need to take rest days as I do not really work out much, first of all because I am a beginner and second of all, I have dealt with anorexia and EDNOS for years before starting to work out. I decided to start working out in the very first place because I was completely recovered physically. 

I will be really glad if someone helps me out! You can also give me some tips about working out in general, I will be very grateful!

Please don't make any hateful comments towards vegans, there are many vegan bodybuilders. 

I'm open to rational criticism and adequate answers! 

Thank you."

337,workout,"inner knee/inner foot arch pain (beginner injury) hi! i started running about a month ago (complete beginner) and ive been increasing my mileage up to about 4 miles 4-5/7 days a week. on my third week however, i started experiencing sharp/throbbing pain mostly on my inner right knee and my inner left foot (the arch). i prob continued pushing too hard, bc that pain eventually spread to my other knee and other foot as well. 😅

after that i took a 4 day break and did another 4 miles just this morning, and all was well until i felt the same pain in my left foot in the last mile, rip. my knee was okay though.

because of COVID-19 the gyms aren't going to be open for a while (or i'm not 100% comfy with them) and where i live the winters are really cold and start relatively early so i'm not going to be able to get outdoor exercise for a while.

anyways, i want to be able to keep up cardio and i have enough money saved up where i can afford a small cardio machine. it doesn't need to be the best, but i need something that i can consistently do most days.

currently, i'm trying to decide between a bike trainer and a folding treadmill. i'm looking for something around $500 but i could go with something up to like $800 if necessary. my room is also not massive (8ft by 12ft including a double bed and a desk) so i would also appreciate something small-ish, or that's easy to put away.

i am trying to get back in shape. Had a really good one some years ago, but lost it to laziness after getting into a long term realtionship...somebody knows that feeling? ;-)  
I am now lifting every other day again for some time and i also started running again. I am reading a lot about fitness, eating etc. I need to lose weight and also want my muscles back. It´s a long way to go but so far i am enjoying the sweaty journey. 

Unfortunately i have noone to really talk about that topic, because family and friends are not much interested in these kind of things....so i hope to find an online buddy here. Maybe you are on a similar journey?  
It would be nice to have someone i could tell about my new Deadlift PR or how i went for a run altough it was raining cats and dogs, how i did my 10.000 Steps for 3 weeks every day etc.  
And for sure i want to know about YOUR goals, achievments and problems.

If one of us starts beeing lazy the other person can motivate him, we can exchange training plans or kinda compete. This would mean regular conversation (pref. Whatsapp).

Some information about me so that you know who you would engange with:   
I am a 29yo male from germany. I am married and working in an office job.   
I am 1,98m tall ( 6″6 ) and my weight is 120kg ( 264 pound ) probably about 35% body fat.  
2013 i was 100kg ( 220 pound ) with 10% body fat.

It is not important for me where you come from. I am very open minded and interested in different cultures etc.

So will you be my online workout buddy, my digital pen pal or whatever you want to call it?

Have a good one!

3. Dumbbells curls 
4. Chest press
5. Seesaw shoulder press
6. RDL with dumbbells

But I'm scared that my mental health would eventually get in my way, I would like to think that I can make a change and use the feelings of anxiety and self-hatred for the better, to use working out as a way to handle them in a better way but not sure if I would actually end up doing that.

When looking up ways to lose weight via my diet, I always hear foods being mentioned that I physically can't even eat, like fish for instance, im not allergic per say, but i litterally can't force myself to eat it even if I wanted to.

I want to lose weight, but most foods that are recommended to eat are foods that i can barely swallow or just leave me feeling hungry later and I end up binging on unhealthy food. So far the only thing that has been effective even is to just not eat. That's not to mention that most of those foods are tasteless or taste extremely bitter.

So one of by glutes is noticeably bigger than the other, and I’ve been trying to do exercises to target the weaker side, but it seems like I’m still only using my stronger side when I’m going these. Maybe this is just because I’ve only just started these exercises but I don’t want to keep doing them if my weaker side isn’t gaining anything from them.

The exercises I’ve been doing include one leg bridges, hamstring curls, grasshoppers, and swivel raises. I’m not that big into fitness or exercising really so if anyone could recommend easy/ beginner things I could do that would be great.

Hi all, I am looking for a good workout to use with my resistance bands that I bought (total resistance weight is 105lb across 5 bands).  My ultimate goal is to be able to do a set of 10 chin ups (not even close to being able to pull this off). 

Currently, I am following this routine 3 times a week (sun, tues, thurs) 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrn2cbrFHTQ

along with this, i try to do 3 sets of 10 of the following:

drag curls

close grip curls

standing fly

standing press

standing band row

standing rope pulldowns

pushups

For my legs, I attempt some of the exercises from this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76VpyX5AHEI

unfortunately, I don't do them all (i exclude the 'sumo squats', sitting crunches and spiderman crunches).  I do these on mon, wed, fri.

I feel like some of the leg exersizes are harder to do with the band, because i'd like to put more weight on, but then can't pull up the bands in the correct position.  (for example the sumo squats hurt my thumbs if i try to use too many bands.)

My rest day is saturday.

Along with this, i try to drink one thing of protein after each workout.  

My question is, are these good enough exercises to try to get strength?  should I be doing more/less (for example, am i doing too many variations of curls: regular, close grip, drag)? Am I not doing enough leg exercises?  I am open to suggestions on how i might be able to streamline my process if I can.

Also, when's the best time to drink a protien shake?

I know a lot of people are gonna downvote this post and tell me to check the wiki, but I checked it a lot of times and it doesn’t really help.

I’d rather have someone tell me what to start doing, and what to advance to later.

I’d give you all the details bruh don’t worry. 

Until I get help, I’m starting with something simple, and easy so I don’t quit. I’m doing 10 pushups 5 times a day, and I’m adding one push up each day. (For example tomorrow, I’ll be doing 11 pushups 5 times a day)."

471,workout,PPL/Bro split mix? Since I enjoy both PPL split and Bro split I was thinking of going on a 2 week rotation where I do PPLRPPL and then doing a bro split on the next week basically in the first week hitting each muscle group 2x/week with lower volume and the week after hitting each muscle directly only once a week with higher volume and then repeat the routine. Is this optimal or will I miss on some gains by not sticking just to a single split?

I've seen a lot of progress but I've noticed that when I do stuff like flutter kicks or leg raises my legs aren't ever completely straight. I still feel strain in my core so I've always continues anyways, but whenever I attempt to straighten my legs completely, they start shaking.

&amp;#x200B;

**IF THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT PLACE TO POST, please lmk where to post this! :)**  


&amp;#x200B;

Backstory (numbers are in no way to flex, I just think that the information could be handy on recommendations for intensity, etc.).

1. Been doing competitive long distance running since the 4th grade up to when I graduated university.
2. Started seriously lifting ever since I started university. So I guess I have **4 years of experience?** I've **taken breaks of varying months when school stopped since I got lazy (yes I know this is bad).**
3. High school weight: **145LB** with little to no muscle, but also little to no fat (skinny abs). **Best mile time: 4:58**
4. University weight: varying between **153 to 165LB**, more muscle, not too big, good balance of muscle and fat. **Best mile time: 5:11**
5. Right now: last I checked 2 weeks ago I was **180LB. Best mile time: 6:23.** Weight is mostly due to bad habits, COVID-induced depression, and COVID-induced laziness **(not an excuse, but it's the best I can come up with for the sake of this post).**
   1. But now as an adult that has been released from the crutches of education, I don't have the free time to go to the gym everyday. I've done full body workouts as a way to recomp/recondition my body for workouts when I'm off of long breaks, but now, I feel like all I can do are full body workouts--since I also need to throw in long distance and sprinting workouts in between.
   2. Been currently doing my listed workout for about 2 weeks now
   3. **I am currently 5'9""**  


&amp;#x200B;

**GOAL: To hit as many muscles as possible with a mix of endurance, power, and speed/explosiveness. Current duration of my workout is about 2 hours**  


&amp;#x200B;

Workouts are a variation of 3x8, 2x8, and 4x5 with progressively increasing weight with the exception of calf raises (4x20, 3x15, 2x10) and a couple of other exercises when appropriate. I also do pushups 3 sets to failure every 2 days.  


In the exact order, my current workout I have 3 days a week is:

1. **Dumbbell squat jumps**
2. **Clean and jerk**
3. **Deadlift**
4. RDL
5. **Lu raises (doing them with dumbbells instead of plates)**
6. **Lateral and front combination raises (lateral then moving to front, down, then back = 1 rep)**
7. Lat pull-downs and lateral rows
8. **Bench press**
9. Dumbbell skullcrushers
10. Standing Arnold Press
11. Dumbbell curls
12. Zottman curls
13. Forearm curls and reverse forearm curls (palm facing down)
14. Front dumbbell holds 30 seconds
15. **Dragonflags 3x5**
16. **Ab wheel (able to do them standing, but not at the moment)**
17. Planks 1 minute each (both sides and traditional position)
18. **Goblet squat**
19. **Barbell squat**
20. **Calf raises**  


&amp;#x200B;

**With this in mind, what are other exercises I can include? What should I swap out? Bolded exercises are ones I am not willing to swap out.**"

512,workout,"Effect workouts from Youtube (no bullshit)? \*\*Effective Workouts from Youtube\*\* (sorry for the typo in the title)

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all,

I'm not a fitness guru or anything but I've been following many youtube workouts for years, here's examples of youtubers I have tried: Blogilates, HASfit, FitnessBlender, Chris Heria, Chloe Ting, Pamela Reif, Madfit...

Of all channels I've tried, I liked Chris Heria's workouts the most because it is effective and he explained how to do the workouts properly, but I am not trying to get into calisthenics or anything.. so some of the workouts were too difficult for me.

As a person who's trying to be fit (not trying to muscular), I'd like to see if there's recommendations/programmes that I can really try out. My goal is to gain strength and stay fit. This is on top of other exercises I do in life (e.g. running, swimming).

Thank you!"
513,workout,"Looking for feedback on my weekly routine Hey everyone.

I'm trying to establish a weekly workout beginner plan of my own and would like to get some feedback if possible. I don't know if it makes much sense like this but I'll try to describe my goals and what I do.

The goals are pretty basic, lose weight, improve fitness and become constant. Before that I had either being just going for a run or doing a jump rope workout but not in an organized constant manner. Sometimes I would say ""oh no it might rain today"" or ""shit its too hot"" but not anymore. Now I'll either get wet or my buns will be on fire but I just try to stick to it.
Thus I have been sticking to the following routine for the past 3 weeks:

Monday - Jump Rope Dudes beginners workout: this consists of a set of 20 seconds work, 10 seconds rest. There should be 20 reps of jumping rope and 20 of body weight exercises with the 10 rest in between

Tuesday - go for a 5k run after work (not much but you gotta start with something)

Wednesday - chill (I'm not the fittest dude so I think one day to rest in between is good)

Thursday - 5k run

Friday - JRD beginners workout

Weekend - chill and have fun. Some Sundays I go for a run with my wife.

So I would like to improve my endurance and lose weight as well as to be able to increase to 5 days of training every week. Needles to say I'll be trying to bump it up to 6k in a week or two if possible. I know it is integral to stop eating like a fucking pre-hybernation bear and more like a human being in order to actually lose weight in a healthy way.

Is there something you'd recommend or change? Feedback appreciated"

I used to run and play football around 3-4 years back so I was in shape, had worked out a little back then which gave me slight biceps and shaped my chest a little but since then I've put on some fat around my waist and abdomen fat.


Currently I climb 20 floors of my building 2 steps at a time and I go for a walk.


There comes a phase of a few weeks where I exercise like crunches situps and lift weights but yeah one break and I stop completely.


I'm really disturbed about my midriff and its affecting me a lot so I started climbing stairs everyday for the past 2 weeks . I was curious as to whether there are any exercises which are specifically for the abdomen and waist regions so that I can try to lose that fat and then go on to strength training .


TL;DR - looking for exercises for waist and abdomen fat reduction.

I was a casual lifter before, but I never really attained the body that I truly desired. However, the copious amount of time that I have been blessed with has allowed me to be able to reach goals that I never thought were possible. Since mid-March/early-April, I have dropped around 20 lbs, and have noticed a lot more definition in my arms, legs, abs, etc.
This has resulted from me running and working out daily, while also watching my diet and avoiding bad foods. I'm certainly not at the end of my journey, as I still have a few more pounds to drop, but I also realized that the journey is forever- working out and feeling good is a lifestyle.

549,workout,"Warmup or no warmup? So naturally I’ve always assumed that warmups are essential to having a productive workout, but lately I’ve been thinking about my buddy back in college. He was a foreign exchange student from Namibia and extremely ripped. The first time I went to go work out with him, I started my warm up, and he looked at me and said, “What are you doing?” To which I replied, “Just a quick warmup.”

“Why?”

I told him it was to get blood circulating to my muscles, to which he just shook his head and went straight into a heavy set on the bench press.

It’s been years since I knew this guy, and while I’ve never stopped warming up before a workout, his reaction has always stuck with me. Are there any benefits to working out without a warmup? Are warmups always needed?"

So over the last few months this https://imgur.com/WJkKaIN has been my weekly 'plan'. Im a 29m beginner but have been following my brother who has been acting as a semi coach and guide as we workout together in his gym

Some of it has been really easy to stick to and other parts have failed pretty hard.

The biggest thing that failed was a 6 day plan, i found that i like having a rest day sunday so that Im fresh for Monday and dont build up too much fatigue. But mostly found that 2 rest days made my overall fatigue much better.

The problem is to do this I just started skipping the 6th session, but am struggling to find a way to get everything in.

The other thing I feel like im neglecting are certain exercises, mainly deadlifts, Lateral raise. But again where do i add these? The reason military press is on leg day is already to compensate for fatigues on push day. And pull day is pretty solidly booked. 

Ive been off work due to covid but am returning soon and will have to find a way to cut the quantity down while still getting enough work in..

Any and all criticism is welcomed , I want to improve, and I want to understand what im doing wrong. Im currently in a calorie deficit and have been the entire time ive been following the program, i still have around 6 to 7kg left to cut before i go back to maintenence. Not sure if that matters."

(23M/6'1/240pounds, mostly fat) 

Throughout the years I've realized that I've never given my 100% when I workout

I really do want to tho 

What I mean is that I've alwayse sprinted through my workout plan like it was a shore list. Get in the Gym, do the list, get out. Easy and simple. This phenomenon amplified a lot following my army training. 


Every time I do the least bit of workout. I am unable to go all out. My body and my mind tell me Everytime to slow down and/or push less to make sure I finish the hour/set/distance/rep because their might be another activity that I would need energy right after that. 

(For those who haven't had base army training, a simple example would be push ups. Anytime anywhere for any reason we would start doing push ups. 15? 40? 50? We never knew when and how much. So I kept doing the least bit to try to survive all of these pushe ups because their might be some later on) 


So this is my situation. Does anyone have wisdom about how to go correctfully all out during training? Because right know, I just can't .

Then I did 3 sets of 10 jump squats. After first set, I couldn’t count the squats anymore, too tired. My vision got bright blank spots in the middle, legs and knees super wobbly.

Let me quickly tell you my story before i ask my question.
Since i was a little child i was fat and 2 years ago i hit my highest weight and it was my wake up call. I reached 124 kgs and started going to dietitian and doing exercise, in nearly a year i was able to drop roughly 30 kgs going all the way down to ~94 kgs. My weight hit plateau there but i was fairly satisfied. Since February this year and with corona and whatnot i gained about 15 kgs and hit 110 kgs.
I started working out when the gym opened and going to my dietitian and lost around 4 kgs then i decided i want to build muscles so i increased my dietitian increased my protein intake and i gained some muscle mass  and lost fat. But my weight is the same.
I want to stop being so dependant on my dietitian so i am using an app called (lose it) to count my calories.
But i cannot find the answer for my question, which is? How much carb, protein, fat, and calories, should my daily intake be to burn fat while gaining muscles. And i am talking about bulking good amount of muscles.

My weekly training is 4 days for resistance exercise and 2 days for cardio (110 minutes of cardio each day)

Can anyone help me build my daily intake of food to reach my goal? And answer me on how much and what should i eat?"

583,workout,"My left leg is slightly weaker and smaller than my right leg, how do I even this out? This problem, as minor as it is starting to become an issue with running excercises. So, as the title says, I've noticed a while ago that my left leg (Mostly my thigh) is slightly weaker and smaller than my right leg. I understand that most people's muscles will never be perfectly even, but this differences is noticable enough that it actually makes running excercises more difficult for my left side. 

I want to understand how exactly I'm supposed to even the muscles in my two legs out, and how long it would take. 

I already know that I would have to perform unilateral leg excercises in order to even the legs out, since bilateral excercises force me to lean to my right. 

But the question I have is, how many unilateral reps and sets do I perform for each leg. See, some people say I should work my left leg more than my right leg, so it catches up quicker.

So for example, I would perform 100 split squats on my right leg, but I would then perform 150 split squats on my left leg, since that legs needs the extra work.

This idea makes sense to me, but than there are people telling me that I should work both legs to the same degree, even if one leg is lagging behind. I've heard that by doing this, the two legs will naturally even themselves out. 

So in this instance, I'd perform 150 split squats on both legs. 

So, I'm a little confused here. How exactly am I supposed to go about this exercise? Should I work my weaker leg a little more, or should I work both legs to the same degree. And if you don't mind, how long would the process of evening out my legs take? 

And lastly, can I get some good unilateral excercises that would help me with this issue?"

I’ve been keeping up at my home gym since quarantine, but it’s getting harder to get myself pumped to go down and work out the heavier the lifts get. Any tips on how to fix this?"

596,workout,"Bad genetics? Bad genetics ??

I’ve been lifting for about a year and half now ( started about February 2019). (Have been consistently eating well and lifting properly for probably like 6 months).I started from literally nothing, I was skinny fat, probably about 20% body fat at 137 ish lbs , 5’6, 15 years old. When I first started, I was gaining strength very quickly and muscle at a decent rate. I went from not even being able to do a single pull up to now being able to do them for sets. My other lifts increased as well. I’m now about 132 lbs at 15 ish% body fat. I’ve pretty much just recomped a bit but haven’t gained a significant amount of muscle. I don’t really know what to do at this point and I feel like I have bad genetics for building muscle like I should have made way more progress for lifting this long. Should I just eat more even tho I’m already at a pretty high bf%? When I have tried to eat in a surplus I found that I put on fat very easily even when gaining at a reasonable rate (1lb per week). I’m wondering if I just have bad genetics for bodybuilding?

-I make sure I eat around 1g protein per bw
-I get around 7 hours of sleep on average
-I drink plenty of water
-i train with good form and to failure on final sets"

I'd be walking 10 miles a day to burn the same amount off that I was with the gym. Any help is appreciated.

I will go to an actual gym so I have the possibility to use professional equipment but the problem is I don’t know how to start off. Should I start with a whole body workout + cardio or a split?

Last Monday, I did a pretty intensive arm workout after a pretty long gym hiatus. Immediately, the day after, I couldn't extend my arms past like 90 degrees and had significant pain/stress (ppl refer to it as Trex DOMS). After a few days, the pain receded and I could extend for a larger angle. But still even today, I'm still not able to extend them completely back to normal. Theres no pain or anything, just strain in my elbows when I try to extend all the way. I'm pretty sure it's not rhabado since I'm not feeling any serious pain and my urine is normal. Is this just a long period of soreness, do I just wait it out even though it's been a week? Are there any stretches that I could do to speed up this recovery? The only reason I'm concerned is that most people say this issue goes away after 3-4 days but its been a week for me. I'd greatly appreciate your advice on how I should approach this."

My coworkers told me to go to ED and while there they gave me steroids to stop the reaction. They were saying it was highly likely it was something in the powder that set it off. Just curious if anyone knows what the most likely ingredient to cause an allergic reaction? For reference the powder was BSC Hydroxyburn Shred Ultra."

Whilst I’m improving my times and power I can put down when cycling, it feels like Im stalling and not improving further

I’ve recently started some home exercises and found out that my lower back and core have basically 0 strength. I can barely do situps and my body starts vibrating and gives in after 5 seconds of planking. 

I race crosscountry where core strength is really important for maintaining balance and sprinting in short bursts. Due to my weak lower back and core, my posture suffers a lot on the bike as I rest forward on my wrists instead of holding myself up. 

What exercises are recommended for someone in my situation? So far I am doing hip raises with 8kg weight on my belly but thats about it for my core (I do mostly upper body exercises in the workout as well)

I [M20] have been lifting weights for about 3 straight years. The past year I had discovered I had DDD and Schmorl’s nodes, lose of height I  discs and have sharp pains in my lower lumbar region. I, and my doctor, have concluded this hat I can no longer lift heavy weights, even lightweights can hurt with certain exercises. I would love to stay active and quite frankly I get depressed and more anxious without weights. I have been running for the past 6 months without it disturbing my back too much, which is so great. But, jogging will take a toll on your back eventually as well. I believe light weights on machines are another option and a preferred one if true. No more axial loading exercises as well.

     I am 36 years old 5’10” 318lbs, back in my 20’s I was in pretty good shape (180lbs 13% body fat) then of course I discovered alcohol and a stressful sedentary 60 hours a week job.  After being diagnosed with low Testosterone after however long, I slowly gained all the weight to where I am now.  I have since begun TRT about 4 months ago.

     I have been doing one full meal a day which typically includes like 2 portions of a protein (typically lean like salmon or grilled chicken) half a plate of a green veggie like broccoli, and a little bit of rice (sometimes brown, sometimes white).  After my evening workout I will also have a protein shake (syntha 6 performance) with water and a tablespoon of mct oil.

     I wake up at 6:45am, I will get on a stationary bike and go to at least 5 miles which usually takes around 25min or so, take a shower, have my black coffee, and drink water (usually carbonated cause I have a soda stream) till dinner.  After dinner I will do some weight training, usually working on one maybe two body parts, I love HIIT but I also don’t want to overdo it.  I am usually in bed and asleep around 10:30pm or so.

     My job now is an internet content creator so I am pretty sedentary during the bulk of the day.

     Anyways, I am down roughly 10lbs in 8 weeks and am not looking for a miracle lose weight solution but just wanted to know if there was anything super glaring about what I am currently doing and if I should just stay the course.

Ive tried to cover the basics, other than deadlift which I struggle with from being rather inflexible. I change up sets and reps each session the screen shots were just last weeks first 3 sessions. When I feel like I have total control over the weight or the reps i either add more weight or increase the reps.

Basically I wondering what mistakes Ive made or areas ive neglected?

666,workout,"No equipment home workouts that burn the same as a 7-10KM run? Lockdowns are being implemented here again. Running outside's still allowed, but law enforcement here has been a bit inconsistent with implementing quarantine measures and I'm honestly more worried I might arrested for jogging. I have a small space at home. I could do 100 burpees for time on days when I usually go for a run, but it sounds like something I can easily get sick of doing."
667,workout,"Leg And Back Workout Help - Torn disc in lower back Coming up to almost a year now, I ran into possibly one of the most day to day ruining injuries - I don’t mean to make it seem like the end of the world, it is no more than an obstacle that I have to work with. - I was on an incline leg press doing my last set. I was adjusting my form, and position when there was a sharp, yet blunt pain in my lower back. It was pretty harsh, though bearable. When I left the gym to get in my gym partner’s car. Is when I had made it worse. To help understand. I’m 6’3, and my boy drives a Toyota C-HR. Small little vehicle, and I have to bend forward to get in. Which is when I had the worst of the pain. Leading to not being able to walk without harsh pain, moving my back in any direction would cause me to drop to the ground from how much it hurt. 

I went to physiology to figure out what was going on, as within a week the pain subsided. In which they told me after a few sessions that I likely have a partially torn disc. Which would take quite some time to recover from. As there’s a lack of blood flow in that region, slowing down recovery time. Since then, here and there I’d always find a way to ‘reset’ that injury. In which I’m back to step one in recovery. Few weeks ago while doing a tire change on an F150, I picked up the tire. Bending forward - which I’ve been advised to not do for many things day to day - that ended up ‘reseting’ the injury. Was out of work for a solid for days, because I could barely walk. 

I’m seeking a little advice/ info on exercises for legs and back that I can do to get around the chance of injuring myself again. Ever since that accident, I’ve almost say ‘fear’ returning to ever doing leg press again. I sure as hell won’t touch deadlifts do to the injury. All my physio said to do, was to avoid doing anything that requires bending forward, or twisting my core side to side. 

Apologies in advance if this post makes little to no sense, or seems all over the place. I’m just looking for what advice I can get. 

Regarding leg and back workouts."
668,workout,"Advice wanted So I'm getting into workout seriously for the first time (I've mostly done freehand, without weight stuff inconsistently before) This time though, I wanted to get the routine right.

So how do I do that without starting to look like a circus weightlifter?"
669,workout,"Mild injury question. Low back pain, tight hips, tight quads and hams and tight calves. I have been doing the t25 workouts and I was doing one that required resistance bands the other day. I was using a strong resistance band when I probably should’ve been using 2 levels down. Levels meaning weight equivalent.  So anyway. I’m doing Arnold presses and I can barely get my hands extended up overhead but I continued to try for a bit. Then gave in because I couldn’t do it. But I did stress a bit prior to giving in.  My low back has been hurting since around that same time. Could it be from that one time? Do you think I hurt it badly? I mean I can walk and move pretty effortlessly. I even ran with the pain. It bothers me most when I bend over. Stretching helps a bit but the ache stays. Am I just really tight and not stretching good enough? What do you guys and gals think?"
670,workout,pull up grip I can only do 1-2 pull ups (and like 5 hanging leg raises) until my hands start to lose grip and my arms/shoulders hurt from hanging.

I feel like I could do more than 1-2 pull ups but my hands start slipping so fast and I have to take a break. How can I fix my grip or how do you hold the bar to make it not slip/hurt?

But today I litterly struggled with 1 rep And I have no idea why, just before the lift I did a lot of pushups but I took a 4 minute break"
673,workout,"Took a physical agility test for an animal control officer job yesterday morning and passed everything, but their so called “bench press”. Was it really a bench press or something else? Background: I’m a 25 year old female who considers herself to be in somewhat good health and somewhat fit. I worked in a restaurant for over a year and so I was used to carrying around heavy objects. 

When I got invited to take a physical agility test for practically my dream job (aka animal control officer), I started immediately to go out and walk to the gym every two days. I’d workout while practicing everything on the test which were Sit ups, Sit and reach, Bench press, leg press, and steps. Each category had points ranging from 1 to 3 and to pass I needed 8 points. So for 1 point in the bench press, I needed to bench press half of my body weight (which is 135 or so) and so I bench pressed 76 easy on the bench press at the gym. I tried 90 pounds and that was a bit harder, but I did it. So going into the test yesterday, I had a crap ton of confidence that I could do it! 

All of that was shattered when I tried their so called ‘bench press’. Instead of a normal bench press where my arms start above my chest (which I had practiced on), their’s was where I had my elbows start below my body and you have to push all the way up if that makes any sense. I couldn’t even lift 76 pounds. I was so pissed. They let me move on and try again, but I still couldn’t do it and I wasn’t the only female who couldn’t either. What truly pisses me off even more is that they had the exact type of bench press that I could lift 90 pounds on and I couldn’t use it instead when I asked nicely. 

So my question is the machine they were using for the test considered an actual bench press or was it something else entirely? If it it helps, the leg press was attached to the same machine as the ‘bench press’ and it looked super old, as well."
674,workout,"Irrational fear or better options out there? So I just picked up some resistance bands for the first time, the cable type with the handles. The problem is they are fine until I try any overhead action (I'm 6'3""). By the time I reach about shoulder height it feels like attempting to fully extend will snap them. The manual says the bands are rated for a max stretch of 5x and I'm hitting around 3.5x when it feels like that. Since I dont know which direction it'll snap I'm worried I could end up with a snapped band to the face. Am I just overly paranoid or is there something else I should be doing/purchasing?"

717,workout,"Working out without one arm Hey guys, 

Before we go any further I wanna make clear that I do have both my arms, but one of them has a pretty bad nerve entrapment on the elbow which requires surgery. 

A bit of background. I am a very very unlucky MMA practitioner, who recently got surgery on both my knees and my right elbow due to a tough fight I had. I’ve never been really muscular and ripped, I have a slim build that’s worked ok for me in the past while fighting, but recently I’ve had the idea to get more buff. Unfortunately, during my recovery from surgery, due to over compensation, my left arm got hurt, my cubital nerve got entrapped which generates a lot of pain and strength and mobility loss. I can’t get a surgery till next May due to my work (and since I already recently took quite some time off due to my previous injuries). So I have 10 months in which I can’t get surgery but I can’t also really use my arm very much. My doctor said the nerve shouldn’t suffer permanent damage as long as I keep it rested, iced and do my stretches until we can go ahead with the surgery (and luckily my job doesn’t require me to use my arm very much). 

But... I still wanna go ahead with my goal of getting fit again, and hopefully ripped at some point. Do you guys have any suggestions what exercises or routines I could use? What muscles could I work? In general what I could do to get fit and looking good without using my left arm at all? Is it even possible? 

Thanks so much for your input. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

726,workout,"Have you ever tried a weight lifting schedule where it's just a full body workout? Hey everyone! So a couple years ago I was really into weight lifting. I had a nice set schedule for different days of the week.

I really want to get back into weight lifting. But the problem is that I still work two jobs and train kickboxing twice a week. I'm too sore from both things (one of my jobs has me lifting things for 8 hours) and I know it isn't good to weight lift if I'm sore.

I have a 27 inch waist but I don’t have hard abs, they’re kinda visible in the morning though when I haven’t eaten. However, I still see myself as fat sometimes because I don’t have a thigh gap (I have narrow hips), and my body type is not exactly curvy so I just look like a rectangle. I have a small chest and butt and most of my fat just gets stored in the lower belly area. I look okay when I’m wearing clothes that compliment my body but without it, I don’t think I’m happy with my body. I don’t know if I should eat less or eat more. I eat clean. Not a lot of carbs, mostly just oats, veggies, and fruits, and sometimes chocolate. And a lil bit of protein like eggs. Any tips or advice would be appreciated :)"

744,workout,"How do you keep motivation up? I've been trying to both loose some weight and gain muscle after a extremely long stint of depression and border lining sending me to the hospital panic and anxiety attacks.  Which I'm starting to get better with as times go on.  I just cannot due public gyms due to sensory stimulation by noises and people greatly upset and bother me an at times trigger panic attacks. 

Before hand I swam 10+ hours 5 days a week and maybe 1 hour a day biking to and from class. Now the pool is unavailable to me.  And not a chance for the lakes or rivers near by due to flooding.  Only sat at 125 pounds even with that much activity and such.

I'm currently 5'3"", 146 pounds. FTM.  Only weight carried in 1 or 2 inch space of my upper hips/stomach.  So easily hidden depending on pants and shirts. Which triggers some of my issues. 

I've gone 2 months straight then poof of easy works out on time 4 to 5 days a week even done with work out apps and such. Pretty much like my sleeping good for a while up in the morning etc then its gone in the wind.  But I just simply cant keep it going longer then that by myself even 2 months pushes it some I'm lucky to even get 4 weeks in.

I however can keep up with my physically fit friends, usually go out every day kayaking/paddle boarding.  Almost daily walks with my mom due to her new pup needing some extra help on walking and training.  Absolutely no issues there but when I'm off alone my motivation goes to absolutely 0.  Unless its swimming then I'm fine put in 2 hours even after not swimming for nearly 5 years.  Only sore for a short period then I'm usually fine. 

I have some small dumbbells at home and a unused treadmill but I worry on the running/jogging. I have a unknown issue with my ankles or well anything below the knee with tendon spasms and a painful sharp jabbing if I land the wrong way on my feet."

And I end it all off with a 15 minute cool-down jog.

If that wasn't all just to motivate myself forcefully I've asked my parents to join in during the begining 30 mins where I'm doing the stretches, gets me doing the the rest of the 1.5 hours of mine and gets them bring healthy as much as possible..heck, I've also tried showing them and telling them to incorporated tai chi with the stretches so that they don't give their usual excuses of back, leg, hand, head, etc ache or no time...but so far it's been worthless (and then I get scolded for giving excuses when I'm gaming or watching stuff, etc...)
To add to this I ain't got no siblings or friends or gf or love-life (yeah!, I know, such boring and worthless life I have...and believe me I've been enough suicidal but worry not, I'm strong enough willed or rather enough coward to not try suicid-ing a 3rd time and I've made friendly piece with my loneliness which feels more at home being in 5his shoes for far too many years to counts in comparison with being in crowds or coworkers or other people...But I'm rambling on anb shit no one on Reddit or in real life in general cares abt as far as I'm concerned so I digress...).

It’s harder for me to run now because I’m injury prone and without the competitive aspect I don’t enjoy it as much.

I’m kind of a twig (5’8 and 130lbs), but I feel like I’m gaining my “you’re not in high school anymore you can’t eat whatever you want and not workout” weight and my metabolism is slowing down. I want to slim down while also gaining some strength.

My university’s gym remains closed and I’m not comfortable going to a public one (just recovered from COVID, don’t want it again), so I’ve just been working out at home. I have a jump rope and some resistance bands, but just can’t afford any weights right now.  I’ll watch those “fitness influencer” type of YouTube videos sometimes, but I just fear that their results are a little unrealistic because they have their own trainer/nutritionists behind the scenes.

Currently I downloaded an app to get me started which has this workout routine:

\- 20 seconds highstep

\- 30 seconds of jumping jacks

\- 8 situps

\- 12 russian twists

\- 16 heel touches

\- 15 butt bridges

\- 10 bicycle crunches

\- repeat from russian twists to bicycle crunches

\- stretches   


I follow this up with prob about a 1.5 km bicycle ride

Wednesday - 3 sets of chin ups / 3 sets on pull ups

Thursday - lighter/more reps deadlifting day

Tuesday - cardio at lunch (HIIT); weight lift at night, (heavy legs)
Wednesday - abs and cardio (HIIT)
Thursday - cardio at lunch (HIIT), weight lift at night (back and shoulders)
Friday - weight lift at lunch (chest tricep bicep for party PUMP) 

Let me know what y’all think about this, or if this is unhealthy / too ambitious, or you have suggestions that could help! I think this would get me feeling or looking good / feeling less bloated bc of all the beer I drank this weekend, but please I’m open to all suggestions.

Edit; I didn’t ask if this was a good idea or not. I know it isn’t. I know how to lose weight and it’s a long term thing. But all I asked for is a quick little few day program to feel less bloated / look more shredded for Friday. So please keep your judgements on why I want to do this and fitness guru testimonials on your extensive to yourself. A little background - I went from ~20-23 body to ~13-15 body fat over the course of a year and a half. I understand how long / how much dedication it takes."

844,workout,"Need some advice on free weights Vs resistance bands. I can’t find any free weights online or in my town or at least ones that aren’t stupid expensive and obviously marked up because of the times. But I keep seeing a lot of affordable resistance bands.


I’m 32, 5’9” and 195lbs (which is to say I definitely have a lot of fat I’m trying to get rid of). I have been working out for a few weeks now regularly (3x a week) with some fun but challenging hikes in between. Going to a gym is not an option for me (for many reasons I will not go into on this subreddit). I started lifting 15# and have worked my way up to 20# and already feel like it’s time to start adding more weight. The problem is I only have a dumbbell set that basically maxes out at 20#. I can squeeze more weight onto one dumbbell but feel like I’m wasting time constantly taking weights off and on for different exercises. Right now weights cost a lot of money (I am a furloughed chef) and from where I am at are very hard to find. I keep seeing adds for resistance bands and on first glance I theory feel like this could easily and cheaply solve a lot of my problems being that I can’t really afford hundreds of dollars of free weights and am restricted to working out at home. How effective are resistance bands? Can I bulk up with them (not trying to get massive but fit and noticeably bigger). I have read a lot of conflicting information regarding them so I figured I’d ask around here. This is my current routine at 20# (my goal is to get to 50#) doing the full routine 3 times with 90 sec - 2 mins rest in between. By the 3 time I’m utterly exhausted and it takes me around 1:30:00 to complete. My arms have gotten a little bigger and stronger and I feel a lot better overall if not a little sore all the time.

I want to gain weight, I definitely eat a lot more than I used too, if anything I’ve lost a few KG. I am very inactive, I basically never exercise.

I want to achieve a weight of 80 KG. I want to be broader, as I am very skinny right now. I want to build lean mass and have muscles. I want to be very strong. I know this takes time, perhaps years and years. I mean, I should’ve took the advantage of Lockdown. I was at home since Mid March, that’s 4 months. Anyways. It’s better to start now than never, right? I definitely want to see some results within a month. I know I’m not going to be 80 KG, If I work really hard perhaps I’ll gain a few KG. That’ll motivate me and push me harder to gain more and more weight.

I also have Asthma, my stamina is very bad. I get tired very quick and I am very unfit. 

I can’t do a push up.

There are so many different exercises to do and things to follow. 

I want to 
- Gain Weight (80KG Goal/176 lbs)
- Become Very Strong Or A Lot Stronger Than I Am Now
- Be Broader (As I Am Very Skinny Now)
- Have Better Stamina

My Questions:
1) Whats the minimum weight I can gain per week?
2) Can you please give me a plan? 
3) How much do I need to eat?
4) Should I focus on eating right now?

Please help me on my journey.

893,workout,"Should You Wear Gym Supporter or Jockstrap  Adding workout in your daily routine is an important part of a healthy  lifestyle. But working out, in any way, weather you are playing a sport  or going to gym if not done properly can lead to minor as well as major  injuries in several cases. So, often it is recommended to wear some  safety gears in order to prevent such injuries. One of such gear is  Jockstrap or often known as Gym supporter. 

 

## So what is a jockstrap or a gym supporter?

A Jockstrap or supporter is an undergarment that helps to keep  testicles intact and support male genital. A lot of people don’t  understand its importance or the science behind it. And therefore  neglect using it. But as the saying goes “Prevention is better than  cure”. So today I am going to tell you how it works and why it is a  better and safer option to use a Gym supporter or a Jockstrap.

There has been a lot of debate and speculations weather wearing a  jockstrap or supporter is important or not. Many out there believe that  it is not at all important to wear them. Supporter and Jockstraps are  considered to prevent Hernia .A Hernia is a condition where of abnormal  exit of a tissue or an organ. Such as bowel and other abdominal parts.  Hernia can be caused due to a lot of reasons and one of them could be  lifting weights or irregular jerks or movement in the abdominal cavity  or genitals."

896,workout,"I gotta fix this newly drooping booty, with banana rolls. Advice needed and appreciated! 
I’m 5’9”, 128 lb, 40 year old woman. I do not want to lose weight. 

So over the past few months I’ve been out of work (yay Covid). I have worked on my feet all my adult life, predominantly bartending. I’ve gone from working 4-5 days to almost no work. 

I’ve recently realized my butt (especially around tail bone) is often sore. I sit more now than I ever have. I also sleep on my back so that doesn’t help. And my posture is shit. 

Also just recently, there’s a droop in my butt to the point that I can now feel it touching the back of my thighs. I hate it. I’ve had a slight banana roll already, and now there’s more, both cheeks. 

I walk my dogs every day, anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes depending on weather. That’s my only exercise of late. 

I do have a gym membership, though I’d like some at home options, too. 

I’ve had all kinds of advice and I don’t know what to do. Deadlifts? Squats? Bridges? Resistance bands?  Stair master?
I’ve heard squats aren’t enough, and when I do them I often don’t feel much in my tush, but in my thighs. 

Again, I don’t want to lose any weight. What are my best options?  I’ll do whatever I can to get the quickest results/turn around this sore feeling!

If anyone is willing to review my workout routine and meal plan to let me know what they think I would greatly appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Me

At some point during this quarantine I realized that I was starting to gain weight. I picked up running for the first time in my life and discovered that it made me feel fantastic – mentally and physically (I’ve been running consistently for the last three months, usually ranging from 3 – 8 miles). It also made me realize how many areas of my physical care I was neglecting. I’ve always tried not to go overboard with my eating – meaning reasonable moderation and avoiding chips and the like whenever possible, but I had never cared about it all that much. As I watched those five pounds melt away I realized how out of shape I was since I hadn’t done any sort consistent strength training since high school (when it was forced). I decided to take a deep dive and figure myself out while I still can. I’ve very recently learned that I have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the coronavirus, so my running is coming to a grinding halt and the gym is off the table. I do have membership to a gym that I’ve rarely used, but for purposes of quarantine and some other timing factors I am trying to build a routine based around the equipment I have available to me at home (which is admittedly limited).

Goal: Build up strength while maintaining low body weight. Let’s be honest, I want to be able to see my abs, flex in the mirror and be proud of my body for once in my life (not that this is necessary in order to be proud of your body, but it’s what I’d like to achieve). Based on what I’ve been doing so far I’m already seeing improvements all around (weight loss, toned calves (from running), starting to see the glimmer of some ab definition, arms are getting a little more muscled, etc.).

# Equipment

I don’t have much – I inherited a “Marcy by Impex” workout machine (This one isn’t mine, but it’s the same as what I have: [https://offerup.com/item/detail/581119396/](https://offerup.com/item/detail/581119396/)) It’s got a few different attachments not shown in those images, but fundamentally it has:

Seated Press

Seated Lat Pull-down

Seated Leg Curl

Chest Fly (? – Your elbows are bent so I don’t know if there’s a more appropriate name for this one)

There’s two other hooks on this – one right at the head for pulling forward with the V shaped grip you see in the second/third pictures, and one at the feet that you can see in the third picture at the very bottom. I don’t know how to use either one of these – I currently use the lower foot one with a (provided) chain and single hand grip to substitute some arm curls.

I also *just* got one of those door-frame pull-up bars and got that set up. It’s brand new though, so not actually part of my routine.

I don’t have a bench, barbells, dumbbells, medicine ball, or really anything else besides what I already said. And considering how hard/expensive those things are right now I wasn’t planning on buying them any time soon. Part of me was playing around with following some YouTube guides and building some basic racks myself and buying a dumbbell and really improvising with it, but (A) I realize how dangerous that is to build something like that, especially since I live alone and don’t have a spotter and (B) I can’t leave the house for two weeks now.  
   
 

# Workouts

I’ve summarized my current plan that I’ve been using mostly for about a week. The long runs are not time based and I’m far from a fast runner, though I do try and push myself a bit on the short runs. For my upper body workouts I mostly just go through say, 4x10 reps on a variety of exercises until I can’t do them anymore, then I lower the weights once and get good and tired then call it. This is unstructured and not a good long-term strategy, but as a beginner I feel like it helps me ease into the routine without overdoing it and is better than nothing.

Exercise Routine so Far: \~3 Months of consistent running, slowly adding in some ab training (\~2 weeks ago), adding in some upper body training (\~1 week ago), adding in some lower body and yoga training (a few days ago).

Sunday: 5 Mile “Long” Run (\~50 minutes), Strength/Flexibility Focused Yoga (\~30 minutes)

Monday: 3 Mile “Quick” Run (\~30 minutes), Ab Training (\~10 minutes using cheesy 90’s 8-minute-ab videos as suggested by a mainstream youtuber), Lower Body Training (\~30 minutes)

Tuesday: Ab Training (\~10 minutes), Upper Body Training (\~30 minutes)

Wednesday: 3 Miles “Quick” Run (\~30 minutes), Lower Body Training (\~30 minutes), Yoga (\~30 minutes)

Thursday: Ab Training (\~10 minutes), Upper Body Training (\~30 minutes)

Friday: 3 Mile “Quick” Run (\~30 minutes), Ab Training (\~10 minutes), Lower Body Training (\~30 minutes)

Saturday: Ab Training (\~10 minutes), Upper Body Training (\~30 minutes)

946,diet,"What am I really supposed to do to lose weight? I’m 14F 152cm and 52kgs. My goal is 45kgs. I don’t know what to do, I’ve been told so many things that I don’t know who to believe.

It’s a lot harder for me to lose weight since first of all, l live with my parents; my mum and dad cook all our food and it’s not under my control. Second, we’re Asian so there’s a lot of rice and carbs, once again this is out of my control so becides reducing it, I can’t do much about it. And third, I’m 152cm (5’0) which is really short so that instantly means that my metabolism is slower than an average person.

Counting calories did not end well for me at all so that’s out of the question. I want it to be effective and sustainable. I can’t trust what those “healthy gurus” say anymore since their advice seems very general and geared towards older or taller people.

It seems to be impossible to lose weight for me specifically. It’s like I was born to be unfit. What am I ACTUALLY supposed to do?"

972,diet,"A bit of a strange circumstance; any help will be GREATLY appreciated Tl;dr at the bottom— post is a bit of a word salad and I’m sorry

Hey guys, 

I’ll just cut right to the chase. About a year ago I began suffering a pretty intense mental break, and have since been diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar type disorder and sort of gave up on life. I gained 60 pounds and was a paranoid, delusional mess up until quarantine kind of began. 

I had a pretty great talk with my uncle and he told me that even suffering is a valuable experience and since then I’ve began working out substantially and even joined a boxing gym. My resting heart rate has gone from 76 bpm to 64 and I’m losing weight like crazy. 

My only issue is this: I’m burning so many calories a day that psychotic symptoms start to manifest again presumably because of the deficit— the brain works in a very top-down sort of way. 

So my question is, since I’m burning around 4000 calories a day, and plan on pursuing boxing as a form of discipline and self mastery. That being said, what should I be eating? What macros and micros should I focus on? It’s a ton of cardio, and I really don’t know much about anything. I’m sorry if this is all over the place, and if this isn’t the right place to post this but any help literally transfers into mental well being. I will try anything. Thank you all so much. 

Tl;dr: I’m pretty severely mentally ill and burning a lot of calories through boxing and cardio a day, and don’t even know where to start in regards to a diet. Anything, even a foundation, helps me immensely."

987,diet,"Gilbert syndrome and Oatmeal (bilirubin and manganese interactions) Recently, I was surprised to find I have been diagnosed with Gilbert syndrome from a blood test, although it did explain my persistently yellow eyes for years without any other health complications. However, looking into it further, it started to make me worry, since I eat about 200 grams of dry oats with milk a day and they have a very high amount of manganese. If I understand it correctly, Gilbert syndrome is a liver defect implying that there would be a higher absorption of manganese, which makes me worry, since I am already near, but under, the recommended long-term amount of manganese a day. A too high consumption of manganese can lead to manganism which is a serious condition.

Hey all,
I was put on a diet/lift plan a week and a half ago for shredding (burning fat and maintaining/slowly building muscle). I ran my macros by my nutritionist friend and he said the plan that I’m on is gonna hurt me in the long run.

I’m 5 foot 9, 160lbs, 4 years of lifting experience, and 21 years old
The diet plan I’m on is 160-170g protein, 200g carbs, and 60-70g fat.
The lifting plan is 10 min cardio after each lift, 30 min cardio on the three rest days that i have. The remaining 4 days are for the muscle groups, doing each group once a week with extremely high volume (drop sets).

The diet is doable and the workouts are pretty intense. Although my friend told me that the carb intake is too low and i could be losing muscle in the process due to being in a catabolic state. If this is true, how can i tweak the diet? 

If any experts come across this post I’ll happily elaborate more personally.

i was wondering if there might be a subreddit or resource, where i, or any person, can explain their lives and eating habits, the resources they have in their lives and the challenges they face losing weight,

i have found that when speaking to other people about weight loss, i have to explain in great detail my personal financial and lifestyle situation, and that due to poverty, i don't have all the resources and possibilities another person might have.

In my personal life that i have some unique challenges that come with living in poverty that i have to work around and i think that it might be a good idea to try to explain to people what my challenges are, and once they understand what my challenges are, they can start suggesting lifestyle changes that are within my actual reach.

so my question is, is there a subreddit or some other resource where people can explain and learn their personal lifestyle situations and people can offer advice while understanding the person's lifestyle and limitations and they can both work together effectively?

I wake up at around 2:30am so I can start at work at the same time as my colleagues (9am their time) and finish around 11am. It’s a bit strange waking up and going to sleep so early but it’s been great so far! 

I’ve just been struggling with figuring out when and how much to eat when my day is structured so differently from my family members. Right now I have a big cup of milk tea and a pastry/toast when I wake up, another snack around 9am to keep me going, lunch at 12, maybe a slice of fruit at around 3 because I get hungry, and then dinner at 5:30 with my family. By the end of the day I have very little appetite but still join my family for dinner because it’s the only window in the day when we’re all together. I’ve been feeling a bit bloated and unhealthy since I started this arrangement and was wondering if anyone had any recommendations on how to plan out my meal times? The food I eat is all very healthy and hasn’t changed since I started work, so my conclusion is it’s the strange eating schedule that is messing with my system. I feel like I’m eating double the food to match meals in both time zones.

I live with my boyfriend by ourselves and we make decent money but not enough to go completely organic or buy a lot of groceries all the time. I want to lose weight desperately, and have been looking at ways of doing so over the course of this past 8 months. My lowest weight was 195-200 and that’s where I’d like to be at again. If not 240 at the least. 

I’ve tried going on several diets and lifestyle changes, but because of my busy work schedule and life I tend to break those and opt for something quick and easy because I genuinely never have the time. And also, my entire life I was raised on fast food and junk food so it’s what I’m used to. 
Here soon I’ll be off more often after we move and I really want to get started on getting my health together. My feet and ankles have been swelling along with horrible acne and my PCOS symptoms because of my weight are out of control. I have not been diagnosed with diabetes or been told that I was at risk, however it does run in my family. 
I know it’s time for a diet and a big change, does anyone have any advice on where to begin for meals? How much I can save? I’m genuinely concerned for my health and getting to a doctor or dietician right now, especially during the pandemic, is not really something I can afford or do right now."

But maybe a month or 2 ago I just changed EVERYTHING to get more fit by switching to eating avacados, spinach, broccoli, salmon, tuna, turkey, baked chicken breast, lentils, fruit, and eggs. So...

Will my body begin to change (get in better shape/toned) JUST BECAUSE of the new foods I'm eating?

Or

Is it more about calories? As in... Could changing my diet drastically from my original diet to my current diet (above ^) have no change to my physique AT ALL just because I'm still consuming a similar number of calories as before? 

I'm ok with ""getting in better shape"" (losing body fat) taking a year or so, but I just wanted to be certain of those two things ^. I've been on this new diet for 2 months max and I haven't noticed significant changes yet, but I'm assuming it takes longer.

So I'm Male, 5'6, and was at the start 140.5 lbs. I dieted for 3 weeks, still eating what I wanted, but drinking less coffee with sugar and sodas, and also calorie counting and eating a healthy amount. I was recommended roughly 1550 calories a day by an app with a goal of losing 1.5 lbs a week. Seemed easy enough so I did just that for almost 3 weeks and ended up losing 3 pounds. I was down to 137.5 the other day and was quite proud. My friends and family were going out to eat and I joined them. I went over my calorie count by roughly 50-100. I was at about 1650 for the day. 

But then when I checked the scale the next morning, although I still looked good, I weighed 139.5 gaining 2 pounds back of the 3 I lost.

I almost don't believe it and I'm just gonna diet the next 2 days and hopefully see it was just a fib because of leftover food or the macronutrients in my system I had eaten the night before."

I have found in doing this that I have lost quite a bit of weight and I'm really happy for it. Here's the thing though, I don't know if I am getting enough vitamins and things. The problem is my family mainly only buys junk food. I eat things like granola bars for breakfast and peanut butter sandwiches for lunch. But then on top of that I often eat a few chips or another granola bar because I feel like I'm starving. I also take multivitamins most days. Then for dinner I eat whatever my family fixes. It often consists of hotdogs or pork chops or things like that. Fruit is kinda a special treat for me. I'm gonna be honest, I know this isn't the best diet in the world. However, I'm just not sure if I'm getting enough nutrition from what I am eating. I'm just trying to work with what I have, while also ending up eating fast food multiple times a week, but have cut back how much I eat from those places. I'm also a very picky eater. I don't eat any seafood at all. I don't eat broccoli or most greens besides green beans. I don't eat rice (which I don't think matters for this). I also only eat a little bit of cheese, but can't really stand it on its own. I'm sure there's a ton of other foods I've just forgotten about. Also, I used to drink milk everyday, but I stopped doing that due to stopping breakfast for awhile due to throwing up and have since found I feel bloated after just a cup of milk. I have no idea why though when I used to chug a whole tall glass of milk just fine. Either way, I'm sure this diet isn't the greatest, but I'm really trying with what I have. I'm just wondering though, is the nutrition I am getting healthy from what I am eating and am I getting enough of things I need in my diet?"

I'm 23 years old/male. 6ft tall and weigh around 74kg of cookie dough.

I'm attempting to lose around 4kg, but my weight just does not seem to budge and I'm not sure why at all, as I feel like I'm eating in a calorie deficit and fighting against a massive appetite. One thing to note is that I am in a severe vitamin D deficit; would this impact fat loss at all?
Here's what I eat on a daily basis:
*3x slices of toast [70 kcal ea] with 3 whole eggs
*2x packs of instant oatmeal [35g packs, at around 130 kcal per pack]
*1/2 bag of 125g pack of rice with 125g chicken breast [raw weight] and 100g frozen vegetables
*1x fruit [Peach/Banana/Apple/Pear] with 1 small yoghurt [Normally the Alpro soy ones, sometimes I get Activia ones, roughly 100 calories per small pot]
*3x rice cakes [25 kcal each] with 30g peanut butter.

I feel the portions are adequately small for me to be in a deficit, as I don't imagine that it all adds up to more than 1800 calories, yet my body does not change at all. If anything I feel like my stomach is constantly bloated and I lack energy, which I've felt for a very long time. Aside from being vitamin D deficient I've no health issues.

1110,diet,"Ketosis Doesn't Work Anymore Backstory, I've been on the keto diet for over a year now. I had lost over 60 lbs in the course of 8 months.

However, the last few months have been frustrating. Without diet change, my body is no longer able to get into ketosis state. My diet didn't differentiate or course differently. I have been using this diet since the beginning. I monitor my ketosis using ketostrips and up til recently exogenous ketones pills. Even with these devices, my body cannot get into the ketosis state.

I've gained back 30 plus Lbs. My assumption and theory is that my body adapted to the high fat diet. Burning the fat for energy instead of carbs. Some would assume this would be a ""Ketosis Plateau"", however, one would have to be in a Ketosis State.

In conclusion, the keto diet works, briefly. But, I will be dropping this diet wholeheartedly and attempting another form of weight loss diet.

I thought it was just that I was getting ""old"" but I've been doing research on BMR, TDEE and I noticed that for my weight, height and age, I should be eating around 2500 calories to maintain weight and eat at a deficit for weight loss, but not below my BMR which is around 1700. I'm a pretty active guy and used to play basketball 3-4 days during the school year for a couple hours. Lately and have been doing HIIT exercises and resistance band workouts 1 hour a day. So what caught me off guard was that I noticed that I would only eat maybe around 1400 calories total in my two meals and I would be perfectly okay. Online people are saying that the amount if unhealthy for me and that I should increase my calorie count but I feel very full eating more. Anyone know why I eat so little and am fine and should I try changing up anything in my diet/exercise/lifestyle. Thanks!"
1137,diet,"Diet for an active 70 year old man Hi guys, wondering if any of you can give me some diet advise I can pass along to my father (70M).

He's 5'7"" maybe 150 pounds and is very active. He plays tennis several times a week, rides his bike around town and has recently been training to complete a challenging mountain climb this November. He is a very light eater and I'm pretty certain that his newest workout regiment is putting him at a calorie deficiency (he says he's loosing weight). 

The thing I need for you guys to understand when you give me recommendations is these changes, in order for them to take hold, will have to be minimally invasive to his current life. He's old you know and too large a change will spook him off the idea of a proper diet. 

From a little bit of research I found the lean proteins in seafood could be a good place to start. It's hard though to find specific advice for an active older man on the internet so I've come to you guys. What are some other ideas like this? 

He might not be completely adverse to doing a protein shake. What brand/nutrients does he need to look for?

I appreciate the advise. I'll take links to any articles, recipes, nutritional products, etc. you think will be helpful too. Oh, and let me know if there's a different subreddit I can cross post on for additional help. Thanks!"

My (33) and my gf (25) are a little out of shape, and 2 months and 20 days ago started some ""internet diets"".  

First four days was a diet where all we can eat was a vegetable soup (with some fruit variations depending on the day). And was great, but she developed  nausea just with the smell of the soup. Here each one lose aroung 4-5kg (8-11 pounds)

Next 30 days was a ""lowcarb"" diet, with 100g cabs maximum per day. Not only lowcarb, we've adopted the ""intermittent fasting"", where you eat only during 8h of your day. She still keep eating very less then her ""normal"" would eat, and i'm eating same or more. In this period i lost more 4-5kg and she nothing. 

Then I convince her to go in a nutritionist, but in the session she talked about ""eat better"", and not in wheigh loss. So she got an helthy diet and started home-working-out with youtube home traning like Chloe Ting challenge.

Of course, I'm on board and keep the trainings with her, and 30 days later I'm lost some weight and she kept in the same as 60 days ago. 

I can not believe in her absence of results. I'm follow her effort and everytime she get up in the balance, i can feel her going down, and my hearth cries with her everytime. I even started eating trash food behind her to stop some of my results, but they keep coming even so.

I've lost 15ish kg so far. At the beginning of last week I weighed 79kg and was 7 kg away from my goal weight, and took a week off from my diet as I went back home to celebrate my 21s birthday. I didn't eat super badly - stayed under 8,500kj most days, just had more sugar than I generally do.

I've come back this week and now I weigh 87kg. I'm really not sure what happened or how I could put on 8kg in one week. I know scales can fluctuate up to 3kg difference either way, but that's still an extra 5kg more than I expected. My body looks a bit bigger than usual, maybe 2 kg heavier than before I took a week off, but definitely not back to how it looked at 87kg.

First post here and I'm hoping it's the right place.

My job is fairly physical and I walk anywhere between 6 to 12 miles 5 to 6 days a week as well as carrying and lifting various weights throughout. 

My frame is fairly small with muscular legs and arms but my stomach is refusing to slim down. 

Until recently, I would eat 600/800cal at work and then pig out on a lot of snacks and a large meal at night.

For the past 3 weeks, I've been eating more calories at work (around 1000 minimum) with food containing wholegrain, veg, chicken and a little fat. 

I've been feeling really full recently so have stopped snacking (for the most part) but it feels like I've been eating so much more and going over my recommended calories, yet I feel like my stomach/waist is getting smaller and feeling slightly more toned.

Is this a normal reaction to eating a lot more fibre?

Thanks in advance!

My question, which I haven't found a clear answer to, is how vitamins affect mTor.

Simply put, the effects of increasing or decreasing protein consumption on mTor are clear, but how do multi-vitamins play a role? does taking multi-vitamins also increase mTor, or does it decrease it, or even, maybe it doesn't effect it at all?

It looks like research bounces back and forth about how close to your workout you should eat or not eat. So I am just looking from tips from people who may be doing something similar and how it’s working."

IBS means I'm not so good with legumes, so beans are pretty much out. 

Alright.

Histamine Intolerance means I can't eat any canned food or processed food or I'll break out in hives, so I have to make everything fresh and clean from scratch.

Riiiiight before shut down in March, I got a bunch of tests done, and it seems I'm Hypothyroid. I've not had a chance to get to a doctor about it, trying to wait it out for the plaugetimes to be over.

I was living on lots of cabbage, because it keeps for a long time and I'm shopping online. My dinners were literally half a cabbage and half a cauliflower and some shallots roasted in the oven with duck fat. Pretty goddamn delicious, really. I was happy. 

My breakfasts have been smoothies with Collagen Peptides, powdered greens, and fruit.

My desserts have been peaches and milk and ice in the blender.

I've been using sea salt for months, not realizing that iodine is necessary for your Thyroid. Last month I realized that bit, so I switched to idodized salt, but kept eating the same diet, hoping my issues stemmed from diet.

Now I've found out that 90% of my diet is also bad for hypothyroid. Cabbage, bok choy, cauliflower, peaches, spinach, kale, all of it. 

So.... what do I eat now?!

I am on Disability, so I am dependent on my Food Stamps and can't spend much more than my allotted $189 a month for food. I thought I found the answer with living on cabbage.

I am really at a loss for what I should eat now. I've been trying to really limit my animal products to what I can locally source or find humanely. (Get your collagen peptides from New Zealand! Avoid cow products from Brazil!)

I'm trying to lose weight and I'm doing a decent enough job at it. lost 30 kg before i injured my arm and then came Corona. now i gained back some and i need a plan.
i go to the gym 3 times a week and i have a pretty good idea of what to eat. i have some weaknesses that are keeping me down and i just can't find anyone or anywhere to help me with these realistically.

my biggest issue is i grew up with a single student mom and later struggled with unemployment. we never had that much and it taught me to grab as much as i can whenever there was something good.

this means i over indulge whenever stuff just lies around. i just can't help it. i will f'im eat it. i can bypass this when i do grocery shopping because I'm pretty disciplined that way. somehow chocolate cake loses its appeal when i have to pay for it. this works very well and i cook good meals but at work we have this snack cupboard with the worst shit in it. it's free and i can't get past it, especially because I pass the cupboard a couple of times a day.

I basically wanted to ask if anyone else with GERD out their has any good weight loss tips or recipes. my current diet consists of chicken, turkey, whatever vegetables if feel like having(im not super picky), and my go to snack is cereal, granola, and peanut butter. other things i buy are like sugar free Gatorade or low fat cheese for quesadillas.

1222,diet,"22 years of drinking ONLY water. A friend suggested that I should make a post about a weird/unique thing I have went through all of my life and I thought it was a good idea to share this story and answer any questions you may have about it. 

Little backstory: I'm 22 years old from the UK and the only liquid's which have ever entered my body are breast milk (as a baby lol), medicines such as a Calpol, cough medicine and Plain Water. I've always been curious to see if there was anyone else who has had the same situation as me, and I've came across a lot of people who have said ""i only drink water too"" but never found someone who has actually went their life without a single flavoured drink. I would assume there are people who have in 3rd world countries where water is literally their only available source but other than that I'm not too sure.

As a child I was always physically sick at the sight and smell of drinks other than water and could never even imagine trying them. Being in reception (kindergarten for Americans) there would be a tray of juice for the whole class and then one single cup which was water which would be mine, over the years people would always ask me to try knew things but there was never any logical reason for me to do so, I was always completely satisfied with just water. 

I was never tempted by any other drink, however, I am at the point now where I am very curious to see how my body/mind would react to a shot(s) of straight Vodka. It would be going from the most mild drink to the most extreme. I've never understood how alcohol can alter someone's brain so much and I'm curious to see how it would affect me. 

If I'm to break my streak at some point I will definitely write another post about it.

If you have any questions or anything to say about this please comment on it, very interested to see what people's thoughts are on this!"

It has worked, I've lost weight in 3 months. I can't tell how much, since in my mind, it was about eating better more than anything, so I never weighed myself.  

I exercise, now more than when I began. As of now, I'm exercising 3-4 times a week for about 45-60 minutes. That's mostly cardio since I don't own weights (and prices spiked since covid-19). I jump rope for about 15 minutes, 15 minutes of jogging in place, and the rest on various exercises such as high stepping, jumping jacks, core exercises, squats, etc.  

I've been eating, almost everyday, oats and eggs for breakfast, shredded skinless chicken and a mixture of cooked vegetables for dinner. For lunch, it varies since I eat at my job's restaurant, and here is where I thought most of my calories came from, but always on the realm of healthy.  Of course, every other day I've had sandwiches, patties,  what you would call a cheat meal on a weekend, some cookies in a morning etc. So I haven't deprived myself of anything.

I became interested in learning how many calories I consumed after reading an article about how drastically cutting calories was bad. And to my surprise I roughly eat between 1400 and 1700 a day, which if I'm correct fits in ""drastically"". 

I've never felt unusually hungry, I've never felt like I can't do my exercises, or lack of energy, and haven't had trouble sleeping, etc. 

Now, should I worry? I don't want to slow down my metabolism or cause weight gain in the long run. Should I eat more? 

I also am planning on buying weights to add to my exercises, and I'm worried that maybe I'm eating too little.

My problem is I binge eat, I have no motivation,  I can't keep up with healthy after 1 week because I slip into old ways. 
I will eat anything. My meals are sensible but probably too big, I always have seconds, and I snack snack snack, I eat more post 6pm than all day. I NEED salt sugar fat all the time. NEED.  I don't eat junk food, like McDonald's, I cook all food from scratch, I don't have microwave meals, but do eat pizza  once a week, i do drink too much alcohol, I can't cut down so if I want to stop I have to stop completely but only manage 6 weeks then I fail and reach for the rum and coke gin etc
I am probably depressed but who isn't?
Every thing hurts so I can't imagine how to even start exercising until I've lost a bit. I just don't know how to get motivated to start and how to carry on sticking to a plan. I eat when I'm already stuffed. Especially when period is due, definitely hormone feeding. I ate a bag of snacks the other day when I wasn't even hungry and that alone was 540 calories.

1287,diet,"Weight Loss Hello everyone,

I’d like to ask some questions. Here’s some context. 

I’m a 21 year old male, about 5’9. Two years ago I was 155lbs. A year ago I was 176lbs, this past May I got as low as 153lbs. Today I am 160lbs. Still, however, I don’t have a slim face, or a slim waist. My belly still hung out and my waist had a lot of fat on it when I was 153lbs. 

The way I lost all this weight was by intermittent fasting. Started with the 16 hour fast, then got to 18 hour fast, but still overall making healthier foods choices (still some junk food though). 

My weight is good for my size and age, I’m not overweight. If you saw me, you’d think I’m slim. However, when I take my shirt off I look fat. Why can’t I lose the weight on my waist and face?

Another question I have is about my diet right now. I’ve been doing an 18 hour fast everyday for 8 days now. I have a Small Iced Cappucino (horrible addiction) and scrambled eggs with two slices of bread everyday at 3PM. Then, around 8PM, I have dinner (big meal, 70% meat, 20% carbs, 10% veges). 

I know the iced capp is really bad. If I keep doing this, will I even lose weight? I feel like I have to get down to at least 145lbs to have a slim face/waist. 


Thank you."

I've been with my girlfriend for over 3 years now and for the most part things are great. But one of the biggest problems I have is her pickiness. We both want to try some kind of diet soon but i have no idea how to coordinate that with her.

 Me, I LOVE vegetables. I will eat anything short of a few specific peppers and big chunks of onion. My girlfriend likes green beans, corn, and broccoli. And I wish I could say that's not all. She will occasionally snack on celery so long as its doused in lemon pepper. No lettuce, tomatoes (I know it's a fruit dont @ me lol), onions of any kind, peppers, none of it. And it doesnt just end there. She likes almost exclusively fried food or food that's filled with sugar.

I'm not trying to play god or anything over here, my diet leaves a lot to be desired as well but that's why I want to change that. But I dont know how to transition to a diet when you could pull up any ""healthy"" food and she'll find something about it she doesn't like. I dont want her to be miserable eating scraps of food because she doesn't like the meals I make for dinner and I'd never put her in that position. I want us to start exercising soon but if we're keeping the same diet we have now that's not going to mean a whole lot if we're actually trying to lose weight. 

So I guess I'm just looking for advice. I don't want to believe that its just an incompatibility thing because short of our opinions on food we get along great and love each other a lot, hence why we've stayed together so long. Are there any picky eater friendly diets she could try? Is expanding her palate the only option? We also drink a lot of soda, would cutting out sugar entirely be good enough even if she continues with the occasional fried foods and minimum veggies? I'm still new to this so any advice at all would be appreciated. Thank you."

1313,diet,"Weight Stalling Hello all,

Im hopingI can possibly gain some insight on why my physical weight is stalling for weeks at a time during my routine. A brief synopsis about me and my routine:

I am a beginner who has been consistently working out for about 4 months now. While I have worked out many times throughout my life, this is by far the most consistent I have ever been. I would have been classified as ""skinny fat"" when I started. I weighed 230 lbs at 6'2 at my heaviest, and over the course of semi dieting and working out for 3 of those 4 months I got down to 215 lbs, while also gaining what looks like a decent amount of muscle.

I decided to really dive in with my diet since I am working out so hard. So I came up with 2,400 calories 40/40/20, based on a calculator I used on Legions website. Ive been hitting this consistently, and frankly I feel awesome on it. I am never full, and always slightly hungry but I enjoy that. With that combined with a 6 day PPL routine I have made it down to 210 lbs in the last 30 days.

So the issue I am having. I have been stuck at 209-210.8 lbs for almost a week and a half now. I am looking better, my weights are continuing to progress, I am constantly hungry, energy is relatively high, etc. I cant imagine I need to reduce more from a caloric perspective. Im either at the gym for my PPL or doing cardio on my off days, and I do the Sauna almost daily. However since I work from home, once Im done with this I am fairly sedentary the remainder of the day.

Is it possible I am going muscle in place of fat and thats why the scale isn't moving? I know this is possible but I didn't think I would stall like this, which is what happened once I hit 215 lbs also. Any recommendations on what to do?

I can provide more information if needed also.

Thank you."

Trying the same meals as the last time has yielded no results. Below I will post a typical day's meals. I do some resistance exercises with a band and a thighmaster (not just for the thighs, it's a pretty good workout!). 

I sit 11-13 hours a day as a truck driver and live in the truck full time so I don't have a kitchen to use nor space for appliances. I have a toaster oven and usually access to a microwave in the truck stop. Generally I've got two hours of ""me"" time before bed in order to eat, shower or what have you. Okay those are my challenges on with the meals.

Breakfast: 3 hard boiled eggs, approximately 2 oz of cheese generally either sharp cheddar or Monterey Jack 

Lunch: Turkey sandwich on either white or wheat with about 4oz of Turkey. No condiments. Either a handful of spinach or baby carrots. A single serving of a snack cracker (cheese its for example).

Dinner: Generally rice and baked chicken although this can vary wildly depending on circumstances based on where I'm parked for the night. Whatever veggie I didn't have at lunch.

Snacks: Either an apple or grapes depending on prices and availability at the Walmart I'm able to pull into that week. Or beef jerky."

1346,diet,"Diet Changes / Starting With Personal Trainer Hi Everyone,

Wanted to get some advice on calories per day.  Long story short.  I'm 5'9, 29 year old male.  About a year and half ago I weighed 285-300 lbs depending on water weight.  I've since lost about 100 lbs, and now weight between 190 - 200, depending on water weight. 

Long story short, I know that's a cool accomplishment, but its really done nothing for me in terms of self-confidence, dating apps, etc.  I wallowed around a little feeling sorry for myself, but I realize now I just need to keep putting in more work. 

In any event, my goal was to get to 170-175, but I'm realizing that just losing weight isn't going to help me with woman at all, so I'm signed up to start seeing a personal trainer 5x a week--starting tomorrow. 

Here is the actually question:  I currently eat about 1250 calories a day. I \*think\* the trainer is going to want me to start eating more, and I'm comfortable, to an extent, eating a little more. But I never want to look a pound fatter than I look today. Any advice on calories per day.  If I keep eating 1250, am I destroying any chance at making lean muscle gains? 

Also, I'm concerned about adding muscle under my abdominal fat, and looking fatter.

Note, I know their are important nutrition items besides calories. I want to work on that also, but right now this is all from a sense of vanity, so I'm really focused on the calories and appearance aspect, because that is having the biggest impact on my mental health right now. 

Thanks!"

\-Age 31-32.  Quit cocaine replaced with food. Weight back to 210 ish.

Today:  Weight 181

&amp;#x200B;

That brings us to today.  I  lost my job due to COVID, and I said to myself, buddy, you can't sit on your ass eating here.  and I vowed to lose the weight. That was 2 months ago.

I'm down over 20 pounds already and I feel amazing. I'm sitting at 181.

I've had a horrible relationship with food my whole life.  I struggled to stay under 3000 calories a day.  After a week or so of struggling with my most recent attempt (which I was gunning for 1800 calories a day), something clicked and now it's super easy.

I'm *easily* able to stay under 1000 calories a day.  It's not something I target but it has happened numerous times. I'm taking a multivitamin for men, B12, and what I am eating is usually pretty healthy (lots of veggies/fish).

I haven't lost my appetite either-  I was at a special event last week and ate quite a lot, and had no problem finishing a plate my mom had prepared for me for dinner at my parents house, which was my normal portion size.

I have successfully changed my relationship with food, I don't know how, but my main question is if I have to worry about my health in terms of not eating enough, aside from what my body tells me to do.

I honestly can't believe I am eating so little, as I am doing a birsk hour long walk per day, and spending at least 10 hours a day in the house standing up (much of that time playing with a medicine ball).  For what its worth that is the *only* exercise I have done to lose all this weight.

Another main concern is that I am going to lose some of my muscle mass if I keep this up.  Is that likely to happen quicker than I lose the fat?  As I said I am using a medicine ball to work the core/upper body and doing lots of walking for lower, and nearly everything I eat is high in protien.

I am a man, 42 years old. 1,78 meters tall, I weigh around 71 kg's.  I work out about five times a week. Fitness and bouldering. I'm trying to shed some kg's to help me boulder. 

Please let me know if I miss something essential.

Breakfast.

Two wholewheat breadslices with a smoked herring filet between or a smoked mackerel filet (about 80 grams). Chopped onion on top. A pointy pepper, and usually a carrot or a piece of cucumber. Always a kiwi and some other fruit, whatever is in season. 2 cups of strong black coffee.

Lunch.

Two wholewheat breadslices with some ham and cheese in between. Or a hardboiled egg. A fruit. A carrot and some cucumber.

Snack.

A fruit.

Dinner.

Usually between 300 and 400 grams of vegetable (can be anything, cabbage, leeks, spinach, endives, whatever is in season), around 120/140 grams of meat (chicken, turkey or pork) and around 150 grams of various beans, chickpeas or lentils. I stirfry these ingredients with a homemade currypaste, or a mixture of soy and fish sauce steeped in ginger and other spices. I like to experiment with those. I eat a lot of garlic.

Snack.

A hand of nuts and a fruit.

I'll have a beer now and then. Other than that it is coffee, green tea or just plain water.

What do you think? Healthy, unhealty? Can you explain why? 

Thank you in advance"

My strategy is pretty simple I want to consume as many carbs as I burn, I have upped my daily protein and I have aimed to eliminate saturated fats and replace fats in general with the healthy kind. Where things get odd though is I don’t really know how much protein or carbs I should go for. I feel since I’m so big that a lot of the general rule of thumb formula type stuff breaks down a little bit. For example I saw one formula based off of weight to recommend carbs and proteins after a long run. I have peaches and pears around the house for healthy carbs. I ran the numbers and I would have had to eat like 6 pears to get the right amount of carbs, for a snack."

I have a condition however which doesn't do me any harm beyond not letting me know when I'm hungry or full until I'm at an extreme. I have alarms to let me know when to eat, and if I don't I start to feel extremely dizzy and then that's how I can tell I'm hungry. And I don't think I've ever felt full despite how much I've eaten. 

So there's no difference for me eating 1 or 10 slices of bread for breakfast, except if I'm dizzy I eat until that disappears which is after around 5 slices, but for all I know 2 or 3 would be enough if I took a break. And I mostly follow the alarms so I don't get dizzy that frequently.

So how much should one average person with no particular goals for weight gain or weight loss eat?"

Today i weighted myself and my weight was 62.5,
on the other hand yesterday when i weighted myself my weight was 61.5 which doesn't really make sense to me. Both because yesterday it seemed like I lost weight way too quickly and because today I gained 1 kg back even though I stuck to my diet plan.
As for exercise I walked 6000 steps every day, on 1 day I also did a 30 minutes workout and on another day i did another 15 minutes of workout. 
And idk if it's worth mentioning but on 3 days i had around 100 leftover calories that I didn't use because I felt full.
Anyway, the question I wanted to ask is whether this diet is effective or not? Because im suspecting that the moment i reach my goal weight and eat even a little above 1000 calories I'll gain all the weight I lost back."

I always try to get myself to just stop and sometimes it works but other times it’s like I’m subconsciously doing it.  It doesn’t help that we have a lot of sweets and stuff just sitting out, but that isn’t the only problem with it.  I don’t think I’ve been gaining fat or anything detrimental as I have still done my workouts and all my strength training, I did notice a couple weeks ago my weight had changed from 93lb to 96lb, but it had been probably a month or more since I had last weighed myself and I believe that it is mostly if not entirely from muscle because I have become more defined and stuff.  However I just want to stop this awful habit.  It’s annoying me to my core and I hate myself after I do it and I’m not sure exactly how to approach it, and I can’t throw out the foods that I want to stay away from either as I am 15 and live with my parents.   Any help is much appreciated."

Everytime I try to diet hunger pangs make it extremely difficult for me. I am not terribly overweight ( I am around 15 kilos more than I should ) but I definitely want to get more lean.  

As far as nutrition goes I am not mister Healthy but I'd like to say I am doing a decent job at it. I love whole grains, legumes and fruit/veggies ( provided they are in season ). When it comes to meat I hate fatty meat like pork and I love lean meat with chicken and fish being my fav. The only really unhealthy thing for me is when I get crazy sweet urges and I like swallow a candy bar whole or something. 

I am mentioning all these because again I don't think I am super healthy but I think I am doing better than the average man does today. So my biggest problem in losing weight is hunger pangs. I will give you an example for today. 

I ate 2 hours ago a sandwich that included arabic bread, chicken, cheese, tomatoes and letuce. A perfect meal right? after 2 hours my stomach was screaming ( hunger pangs ) and I had to shut it up with food again. This is very demoralising for me and it seriously messes with my self confidence. So how do you guys do it? Do you have tips for how to resist these pains?"

Does anyone know why this is? Am I doing something wrong? I don’t count my macros too hard since I’m in a deficit anyway. I eat more protein than carbs and stay away from sugar.

1570,diet,"Looking for Advice/ Help Hello my name is Joseph and 22 years old male looking for some advice. People tend to be fairly rational and reasonable here so i figured i would post even though i was hesitant. I guess ill go ahead and start off by saying i was diagnosed with post concussion syndrome about 3-4 years ago from a concussion i received in boxing class. Doctors pretty much told me there was no cure and so ive been on a journey trying to figure out why im still experiencing symptoms following my concussions years later. Before i received my first concussion , i was an extremely active dude, training 2-3 times daily. Currently and unfortunately to say i am almost handicapped compared to what i used to be. The good news is i have self diagnosed myself fairly well so i guess ill go ahead and start. I started weigh-training when i was about 12 and i received some not so great advice from someone whos name i am going to keep confidential. He basically told me that i could just train my upper body and not really worry about anything else( i know this is not smart you commenting telling me this is dumb doesn't do anything i was 12 i know that you need to train the rest of your body). I proceeded to do this for the next 4-5 years and put on about 50 pounds towards the end of my highschool years in mostly my chest and some in my shoulders and arms. I recently lost 20 of that and am sitting at about 150 pounds. I noticed when i had lost that weight some of my symptoms improved fairly well. I truly believe the reason why i am still experiencing these  symptoms is obviously based upon the fact that i had put on all that weight causing my posture to take a dive and giving me a slight hunch. I burned myself out dieting the first time and was maybe looking for some advice. It has been hell these past 4 years dealing with this but i know i am going to get out this. I really want to get back into jiu jitsu and being active with my friends but cant really since i still experience symptoms. Thankyou for taking the time for reading this its been one heck of a journey i am still fairly young and am looking to get back to being active. If anyone can give me some advice about how to diet or anything else from my testimony to loose the rest of the 20-25 pounds i would really appreciate it. I am not looking for handouts just any basic advice would help since i was eating about 600 calories a day to 1500 calories on other days to loose the initial 20, but its hard being consistent with that. Thankyou for your time it means a lot."
1571,diet,"R8 my diet plan *Eat a lunch at 8.00, then nothing else
Eating less deminishes the caloric intake, reducing the Energy input, pushing the body to use the stored fat
*Drink as less as you can
So the body will use the fat's water contents
*Do a ton of exercise
Use a LOT of Energy, so the body will start pushing for the Energy, that only the already way less food can provide, and after that will push the body to burn fat
*Sleep 4 hours
Sleeping less makes the body crave for Energy

1588,diet,"Questions about the Ketogenic Lifestyle 
Good afternoon y’all. I have quite a few questions in regards to keto &amp; ketosis and since y’all have probably forgot more about keto than I’ll ever know, I decided to ask y’all for help. (For reference on Monday I was a 6’3 280 lb man)

I started my keto journey way back in May. However because I lack any and all willpower it took me up until about this week to fully commit. With that being said Monday &amp; Tuesday of this week I did eat some fruits, and a very small amount of candy. But other than that it’s been no sugar, &amp; no carbs for me. I have also kept my calorie intake at about 1000 calories a day and I’ve also been walking 5 miles a day which have been burning 800-1000 calories a night. On Monday morning I weighed in at 279 lbs, and this morning I weighed in at 269 lbs. I read somewhere that rapid weight loss is the first sign of ketosis, but since I had fruit and candy Monday and Tuesday I have reasons to doubt that. 

My questions are:

1. Am I in ketosis
2. If I’m not in ketosis would what would cause that rapid weight loss
3. If I had a cheat day or two (which I know is forbidden) would it cause me to gain it all back in a day or 2? Believe me I want some pizza tonight!!

I know I said I had a ton of questions and I feel like I still do, but that’s all I can think of right now. So I may still ask more. 

Please help if you can.

Yes, I get it because those are easy calories but isn't it healthy for me to eat lots of ""crap"" foods. 

My roommates insist I drink chocolate milk with every meal and truly eat whatever I want because of my fast metabolism. But no means am I saying I don't eat junk. I do.

1611,diet,"[Help] New to Calories Edit: Corrected amount of calories burned, which in turn rephrased my question. 

Hey Everyone!

Quick Backstory.

I (21M) am on a weightloss journey. I used to be very fit; I am a Martial Artist and used to train hard 14+hrs a week on top of other exercise. Then I got some injuries that got me out of training, then I got into a bad place mentally and gained about 20-30lbs. Last weigh a few months ago, I was about 225-230lbs. I'm about 5'11"" but have a decent amount of muscle.  
I've since cut down some weight, but I've never worried about dieting or calorie counting because no matter what I ate, I burned in training. 

I recently got an Apple Watch and saw that I burn anywhere from 3,000-3,600 calories a day. Some weeks I can burn more, it just depends on work and my schedule; I stay very busy.   
I cook a lot for myself (typically Korean food \[thank you grandma\]) so basically chicken or thin steak and rice, or chicken burritos with spinach wraps. 

But in order to lose weight efficiently, I heard I need to create a deficit. What’s a general recommended caloric cut? 
And recipe links y’all could share?


TIA!

TL;DR: I got hurt and gained weight, and currently burn 3,000-3,600 calories a day. Recommended amount of calories to cut to lose weight?

I'm male, 40 yo, 5'8"", 229.6 lbs.  I was 267.4 on March 7 when I began to work to lose weight and have lost at a steady rate since that time (graph below).  Can't really account for the one week where I spiked as I did nothing different at that time, so chocked it up to randomness.

Currently my diet is essentially the same thing every day:

Breakfast: Naked smoothie (between 210 and 320 calories);

Lunch: Fiber One bar (140 calories) and flavored almonds (170 calories);

Dinner: Just about whatever I want from pizza to Indian to cheesteak (approximatley 800-1000 calories) or, if my wife cooks, something healthier and typically vegan (approximately 600-800 calories);

Snacks: Dove milk chocolate pieces (amounts varying day-to-day) and some kind of ice cream after dinner (total snack calories 400-800 varying day-to-day).

I realize the above can hardly be called a diet for most folks, but it definitely is for me compared to my typical daily intake.

My exercise routine is also roughly the same every day: I walk between 4.5 and 5.5 miles in the morning and 1-3 times a week an additional 1.5-3 miles in the evening.

I'm satisfied with the pace of my weight loss to this point and would like to continue as above until I get down to 190 lbs.  My concern is that I will begin to find it harder and harder to keep pace without cutting out the snacking and/or significantly improving the quality of my dinner intake.

How realistic is it to continue with the above diet and expect to continue to cut weight?  Will I plateau (I weigh weekly and my most recent two weigh-ins were identical to the tenth of a pound)?  Or will I simply keep losing but at a slower rate?

TIA for any thoughts."

For the past bit my family had been committed to only eating out on saturdays. Both in an effort to be healthy and to save money. They weren’t here last week which is why I ate out so much.

1. Restaurants create an account and are given a custom QR code to print out (and place on menus, or another spot).
2. They input their menu on the platform and add tags to each menu item that violates certain dietary restrictions.  For example, if I added ""Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Sandwich""  as a dish, I would include the tag \[contains nuts\]. If I inputed ""Cheeseburger"" I would include the tags \[non-vegetarian\], \[dairy\], etc on the platform.
3. Customer can then scan the QR code and simply input their dietary restrictions. The platform will  display the menu items they can and can't have!

We already have several restaurants onboard ready for our launch date on Monday. We would love for others on this subreddit to also implement our system so we can together help customers have better dining experiences. Please PM me if you are interested.

1624,diet,"How can I train myself to eat faster if I generally dislike/am lazy about food? I really want to change I really want to change my eating time and habits. But I've always run into hurdles. There are times when I can chomp down stuff fast, and others which still linger when I just take a ton of time. I will REALLY appreciate any help anyone can offer/suggest/recommend.

This is to the point where if it feels too much or I take more than 10-15 mins on it, i will end up procrastinating  and take well over an hour to slowly finish it.

I also do NOT eat faster when I am distracted by watching tv or talking. In fact, I get absorbed in those things and end up ignoring my food, to the point where I feel like abandoning it since it feels like such a pain.

I notice I usually chew really slow when this happens and feel like I have less energy to chew. (But not anything else)

I have this feeling in my head, where I just want to be done with the food, as I tend to not be able to multi-task or focus on anything else until my food is dealt with.

I will note that this happens with food that I have control over/cooked myself AND with food that I don't have control over (Gift/restaurant (what comes in the plate n how it is prepared)/at a friend's place).

I find myself needing to use water to get it down, and really dislike 'dry' food in general, like salad, or bread or any dish that is prepared without a liquid or sauce of some kind in it.

I tend to have a far easier time with anything that is remotely like a 'gravy' or otherwise wet. It's not like I don't generate saliva since when I'm faced with food I especially like, my glands are going crazy. They are also totally fine with gravy food.

However, the inevitable dryness/boredom/laziness WILL happen and set in if I get distracted, or if my plate or bowl portion size is relatively big and it feels like 'It will take a lot of effort to chew and oh man, this is gonna take a long time. Geez what a waste of time. I could be doing X,Y and Z right now.' This is EVEN IF I am hungry at the time. It just feels like less energy spent eating it than doing something else.

As far as what I eat, I aim to eat generally very healthy food, greens, fruits and veggies, lean meat(less red) etc. which also probs contribute to making it a chore to eat. I also have supplements and multivitamins etc, which are far easier to 'eat' obv.

&amp;#x200B;

I will note that when I say I want to learn to eat fast, I don't mean in some crazy, unhealthily fast manner, but more to the point of being able to simply sit down, focus and get the food eaten and dealt with.

Finally, while one solution could be to focus on 'just' eating and paying attention to nothing else (like watching tv shows), I want to learn how I can eat fast AND watch things at the same time. If other people can, why can't I? Can I perhaps do it step by step? Learn to eat fast first &gt; work on eating faster while watching stuff?

As I said, I will REALLY appreciate any help anyone can offer/suggest/recommend. Thanks!"

1631,diet,"Using Calorie Calculator And Hitting A Few Bumps Hi!

My SO and I are trying to calculate our calorie deficits for losing weight. We used the calculator here to calculate it, but before we begin we'd like to get a second opinion about the options this calculator has and the results it has given.

We input our age, weight, gender, height, and body fat as measured by both a physical and electronic caliper. The calipers had slightly different numbers so we met in between.

We input our activity level and here is where we run into our first minor snag. We weren't sure which applied to each of us. Both my SO and I work desk jobs, which is sedentary. My SO does weight training 4-5 days a week for a minimum of 45 minutes, but no cardio. I do strictly light walking for about an hour every other night with some light weight/body weight exercises every other day for under 30 minutes. We weren't sure which one to pick for each of us.

Sedentary has little to no exercise, moderate walking which sounds like me, but I wasn't sure what counter as little to no exercise. I exercise for under 30 minutes, is that considered little exercise or does it fall under Slightly Active?

my SO wasn't sure which to pick because while they thought Moderately Active sounded about right they didn't feel like the 45 minute workout matched up with Construction Laborer. Our confusion may be that the comas separating the descriptions are not all or nothing, but examples of what falls into these categories. For instance, my SO isn't a Construction Laborer, but they do lift weights 4-5 days a week which would fall under Moderately Active correct? Or would they have to lower it to a less active option? If Moderately Active is correct how much time is considered ""Exercise""?

Next was the BMR Methodology, which was auto selected to only Mifflin St Jeor so we left it as is until we asked which would be more appropriate or would a combination of them all be best?

Then we decided we would want to lose about 2 lbs a week which seemed okay, but we weren't sure if it was to much as the maximum amount of weight does have a cap, but its above 2.

Both of our Calorie Intake Targets were under 1,100 calories. Both my SO and I are very short if that matters, I will provide details if needed. We weren't sure if that was safe.

We are also both confused at the color scale with informative messages inside. For instance in one calculations one just said ""UNDER!"" with no information if we run the mouse over it and another said ""WAY OFF"" with a calorie number popup when we run the mouse over it. Does this mean we did something wrong?

Finally, we are doing IF 5 days a week which has our calories even lower then the Calorie Intake Target. Like under 500 calories for me. Is this accurate or should we switch to another calculator.

After speaking with our doctor they only really said, diet is key and that under 1000 a day was bad, but we thought we'd ask here before deciding one way or another.

1689,diet,"Lockdown has revealed my mom's eating disorder and it's triggering me So I always knew Mom had disordered eating but boy, I am starting to flip out since she's been living with us for three months. She's home all the time, without a job or friends, and sits in the living room all day (I work from home) knitting. No signs yet on when she can go anywhere else as she gave up her house and is waiting to move in with my sister once borders reopen.

She comments on everything I eat - if it's ""good"", ""bad"", wanting some, judging it. I am overweight, with my dad's stocky body, and she is thin (from her disordered eating and extreme dieting, in my view). I've dealt with this my whole life and it's caused a lot of issues for me, but not directly for so long since I left home at 18. I'm beginning to lose it. I'm now 40 and she is 65!!!!

The thing is, SHE is the one who bakes and brings junk food into the house for the past 3 months. Ice cream, chocolate bars, chips, alcohol (we don't drink much). She regularly bakes cakes, cinnamon buns, sweet biscuits and slices. Then she'll have one and leave them all for me and my husband to eat while she performatively does not eat them.

This is not new. She did body building for a year when I was 25 and baked and baked and gave it away because not eating made her crazy. Now it's like she is still baking and giving it away and getting some thrill out of not eating it and being ""good"". We don't want the food around - we want to eat better. But of course, i'm not going to throw out 4 pints of ice-cream and the chocolate she bought - it's a waste. We have some in the evenings if it's there, although i don't really want it. I am beginning to think I just need to toss it, though.

Literally all she has in her life is food, food judgements, and food avoidance. Every second comment is about food, vegetables good, anything else bad. I can't handle it. I can't get the comments she made as a kid out of my head ""Well, she's had too much McDonald's hasn't me"" she said to me once about the poor cashier, when we were LITERALLY IN LINE AT MCDONALD'S. Saying ""This is 10 points"" before she ate her McFeast burger. All the Weight Watchers, all the Jenny Craig. On and on and on.

These were the comments today ALONE - and keep in mind I avoided her all day (i avoid her as much as possible, it's a tiny house)

* ""You're not making the salad! It's full of condensed milk. So disgusting. That is the worst thing you can eat!"" (I had left an old recipe out that i MIGHT make)
* ""You might as well inject that cheese straight into your arteries"" (It's fucking cheese, chill out)
* ""THAT'S DISGUSTING!"" (me deliberately squirting whipped cream into my mouth from the can to piss her off - SHE bought it) ""NO. STOP IT."" Like it's causing her serious pain.
* Picking at her waistline while sitting at the table, squeezing her roll there and then saying ""I had an ice-cream today and I dropped chocolate on myself. disgusting.""
* Tells my husband to ""Have more"" and help himself, have another serving, while saying nothing of the sort to me (like every meal for six years)
* ""Ugh, i'm so full etc etc etc""

THAT IS ONE DAY, PEOPLE.

I am about to lose my rag big time and don't know what to do. I can't eat without her comments. I can't say anything to her for fear of uncovering this massive issue for her. She's not educated - she doesn't get mindfulness or anything like that. She would just get really upset and make lockdown even more intolerable. I just need some advice on how do i control myself and avoid the negative feelings in myself that her intensive food shaming causes in me. I have a history of disordered eating too - no wonder - and am trying to recover.

I have asked her to quit it on making the baked goods in the meantime, but any discussion of wanting to eat better feels like a massive can of worms for her to open and continue to criticise me with."

Is it safe? 
Is it work? 
Any side effects to our body? 
And what food can we eat?
Can we eat any type of food or there's a specific food that you can only eat.
And how to get it started? 

 Watching youtube videos only made me confused even more.

Your help is very much appreciated"

I ask this from a digestive health standpoint.

If yes, warm or cold? If no, how long before and after eating do I need to wait before I can drink again?

The issue is my husband has a food issue - like he basically eats a liquid diet.  I have to feed our daughter and my daughter eats healthy and likes similar food.  We usually share a meal while we are out.  Husband is a very picky eater and views food as just to survive.   So I made pesto chicken and I have quite a bit of chicken.  The food I made should last a week but with husband not eating, I feel it’s too much.   Daughter will have breakfast in the morning, sandwich for lunch and chicken for dinner.   I guess my issue is / how can I try to change things up during the week so I don’t eat the same thing everyday?  If my husband ate, I wouldn’t have this issue.    Or maybe I shouldn’t have cooked it all at once and freeze some of it for later cooking."

As far as I know these alkaline-diet food charts do not help because they focus on the pH in the blood, not in the gut, right?
A lemon is very alkaline forming (in the blood) for example.
But what's the effect of, let's say, citrus in the *GUT?*

Also what about pure sugar, grains and so on. Is there a over the thumb rule that states sth like: Omega 3s / soluble fiber / amino *acids* etc. have a certain pH level?

It's confusing to do research because most sources focus on acid reflux and there's a common misconception that acid reflux stems from too much acid, which is not the case. It's caused by too little. But some alkaline foods can give some short term relief. As I don't know what 'way of thinking' the sources applied I can't use them for research.

1728,diet,The Adverse Effect of Yo-Yo Dieting on Your Muscle Mass 
1729,diet,"Super Foods that can help combat Air Pollution Effects Air pollution has now reached hazardous levels in most of the tier 1 and tier 2 cities in the world. Air pollution (ambient and indoor) kills seven million people every year. Immediate effects of air pollution include **irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue**. Some pollutants can also be the cause of asthma and may aggravate the condition of a person who is already suffering from asthma.  Long-term effects include **respiratory diseases, heart disease and cancer**. These hazardous effects of air pollution not only affect the people stepping outdoors but also to the ones satying indoors.  While wearing a mask and avoiding areas with poor air quality is helpful, you should also include foods to combat air pollution in your diet. 

 It is crucial to have the correct diet to fight air pollution. Most important of all are antioxidants, which protect our body from harmful effects of air pollution. So, be sure to include the following nutrients in your daily meals. 

**1.** **Vitamin E:** Vitamin E, a fat-soluble vitamin, is the first line of defence against injury to human tissues. This vitamin usually comes in our diet from plant-based oils like sunflower, safflower and rice bran oil. Canola, peanut and olive oil are also rich sources of vitamin E. Almond, sunflower seeds and nuts also contain the vitamin but you should keep a check on their consumption due to their high-calorie content. Non-vegetarians can include salmon, roe and eel as a part of their diet to fight air pollution. Spices and herbs such as chilli powder, paprika, cloves, oregano, basil, and parsley also contain vitamin E.

**2.** **Vitamin C:** It the most potent antioxidant for our body. Vitamin C also contributes to Vitamin E regeneration. It is easily available in citrus fruits. Adults require 40mg/day of this vitamin. Vegetables like coriander, drumsticks, parsley, cabbage, and turnip greens are good sources of Vitamin C. Orange and guava are some fruits which are rich in this vitamin. It is advised to include the juice of 2 lemons in your daily diet to fight air pollution.

**3.** **Beta Carotene:** Beta carotene is a red/orange pigment found in many fresh fruits and vegetables. This nutrient plays an important role in controlling inflammation and converts to vitamin A in our body. Rich sources of beta carotene are leafy vegetables like amaranth, coriander, fenugreek, lettuce and spinach. Radish and carrots are also good sources.   

**4.** **Omega – 3 Fat:**  Including this in your diet, helps in protecting the body against the detrimental effects of air pollution your heart health and lipid profile. Fishes are rich sources of this fat. Vegetarians can try nuts, seeds like walnuts, chia seeds and flax seeds. Fenugreek seeds, Mustard seeds, green leafy vegetables are also good sources of Omega-3 fat.

**5.** **Ayurveda Solutions:** Apart from the above-mentioned vitamins and fats, Ayurveda also recommends some foods to combat air pollution. Certain spices and herbs that have antioxidant qualities are mentioned below. 

· Turmeric, a well-known antioxidant, is said to help protect the lungs from the toxic effects of pollutants.

· Turmeric and ghee (clarified butter) mixed relieve cough and aid during asthma. Turmeric with jaggery and butter can be taken during an asthmatic attack to relieve symptoms.

· Jaggery mixed with onion juice can be taken during both wet and dry cough. This concoction is said to have an expectorant effect.

·  According to Ayurveda, a diet rich in butter and astringent food should be taken, as opposed to sweet or sour foods, during asthma. Wheat and cow's milk are also believed to be beneficial for asthma patients. 

· People suffering from respiratory ailments should include ginger, black pepper, tulsi, liquorice, nutmeg, mint in their diet to fight air pollution. These spices are said to help in curing these ailments."

I’ve always fluctuated between 136-155 for my entire high school career (just graduated as class of 2020) but somehow I was able to build a fairly toned body back in sophomore year. I went through a period of smoking and partying after that and I was depressed as well so I lost all motivation to workout or eat. I still have a bit of the muscle from when I would work out but it’s mostly all gone now.

I live in Japan and the most common diet supplement I constantly see commercials for is anything and everything that makes you relieve your bowels BIG and frequently. The commercials emphasize that you can eat whatever you want because the tea/pill/powder just makes you defecate more in unusual large sizes.

I am not looking into this diet as I have IBS, but I do understand the importance of healthy gut bacteria due to this condition. Surely if it's become stool, your body has already processed and absorbed the nutrients?

I’ve been doing a 15 hour fast between 8pm and 12pm every day and it’s helped me sleep and my skin has been way less flabby (except for the past couple days but I’ve been eating junk food). I mostly avoid fast food and I eat once or twice a day with “healthy” snacks in between. For the past month I’ve been eating chicken breast and eggs every day. I eat fruit and sometimes veggies every day. I honestly don’t know a lot about calories and nutrition.

I’m overweight, extremely picky, and in an environment where diet culture is triggering for the people around me. Need advice please 

I’m male, 20, 5’8 and 190lbs. So I’m very overweight, nearly obese. And I absolutely hate it. I used to be a little underweight/healthy, but since moving out two years ago and having to take care of myself it’s like a switch was flipped and suddenly I’ve gained 60+lbs in 20 months and don’t know what the fuck to do. I’m embarrassed of it and I don’t even want to leave the house anymore. 

I’ve tried so hard to lose weight but I’m finding it so so difficult to keep up with it. I exercise fairly regularly but it’s my diet that is really really fucking everything up. I have ARFID (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder) which basically means I’m picky as fuck and only eat about 3 things because anything else gives me massive anxiety and I refuse to try new things. My safe foods are junk foods. So I’m eating chicken strips and fries like 4 times a week and pasta the other days. On days where I try to eat better I just end up feeling so anxious and depressed that I resort back to my safe foods of stuff that’s not good for me. 

On top of this, my girlfriend (who I live with) has anorexia, and she is mostly recovered now but any talk of dieting or weight loss triggers her. I understand this and so try to be supportive in her recovery, by making sure she’s eating big portions and is enjoying her food. But this also is a big issue for me because it means I can’t really start a diet or anything without her also becoming obsessed with weight loss (this has happened before with us). 

I am really, really struggling and I don’t know what to do. I was hoping strangers who don’t know me can just offer me some help. I don’t care if you rip into me and call me fat, I know i am. Just some advice or tips or something. I don’t know.

1775,diet,"An Exploration on Diet and Exercise Why don’t adults play?

Physicist Steven Weinberg wrote, “The effort to understand the universe is one of the very few things that lifts human life above the level of farce, and gives it some of the grace of tragedy.” Quite pretty isn’t it? To think about it all (yes, every damn bit) and wonder how and question why. It is remarkable reflection. Humans find their dignity when they wonder and question. And it requires two things from you: 1) start with yourself and 2) use your fucking head.

On a warm night in a sticky month of a few years ago, my partner and I walked away from our long-term relationship. We will always love each other, but we were no longer in love with one another. Oh, and he found another little crumpet to give his time to. Which, in theory was fine…but not in application. I fell apart.

My eyes would unwelcomingly open at 5 am (an unnatural hour) every day and an immediate explosion would POP in my brain and I’d begin shaking. I’d cry. I was so afraid of the day. I was an anxious mess. I missed him. But what fancied me erratic was the reality that I was going to have to start dealing with my shit. I had been resigned to an “I am who I am” mentality which promotes little other than a low level of emotional intelligence. Oh, and it’s fucking lazy. It was time to deal with 25 years of suppressed and, after I was kickass at suppressing, repressed emotions. What fun. Part of the beauty of prior me (fuck yeah me!) was everything pretty much slipped off my shoulders. Didn’t cry. Didn’t rile. Had a decent time. But I know now that I wasn’t happy, which makes a happy and healthy relationship moderately unattainable.

One way to deal with immense anxiety is our dear friend alcohol. A wonderfully unproductive illusion-inducing drug. Nay, I’ve seen that story too often and she ugly. Comfort eating was out, I was too depressed. I masturbated a lot (a lot). Skipping ahead…I found exercise. But specifically, I mean I figured out exercise. And it saved my life. I am not sure I was going to do anything drastic, but I understood why some people choose to bonsoir prematurely. It is frightening to experience life lightless, but we all do and we all must.

I had to overcome my hellscape. I couldn’t sit at home and I’m not great with pity. So, I got moving. I didn’t give a shit about the number on a scale or how impressive the weight on the bar appeared. I didn’t obsess over counting micros or macros or limit my calorie count. I didn’t live at the gym or designate specific days for lifting or cardio. I paid attention to my mood, energy, and equanimity. I gave a fuck about killing the inner narrative that shook me. I gave a fuck about denying depression its dictation. I focused, I learned, I pushed myself, I rebuilt my self-confidence, I discovered the plurality of strength, and I found a more whole, happier, and healthier me. I learned to prefer to fuel my body instead of merely feed my body. And I went to the gym and I played.

This is an exploration of what I learned. I created this and 4 subsequent papers to be conversational and exploratory. So, why don’t adults play?

\---

Why, as adults, do we become the Augustus Gloop we always wanted to be? Is that what we wanted? What happens between adolescence and fending-for-ourselves that we decide our movement is bed to desk chair to couch to bed? Why is fast “food” - eat french fries like a smoker smokes and see what the hell happens to your health - an acceptable staple? In our youth we had at least one caretaker to jam undesired and poorly prepared nutritional foods (see: squash…no amount of reconditioning is making that mush palatable) down our throats and toss us outside. Now we’re in control and we eat, drink, and do as we please. We’re adults damnit! Are we actually in control?

Body stats: 184cm / 78kg / bf 22%, almost the same before and after dieting. Physique may have improved a bit but I'm not certain.

Diet: Tracked with an app as accurately as possible. Around 2000 kcal daily, which consist of 50% carbs, 20% protein and 23% fat. I rarely eat anything deep fried or sweet. For the last 3 weeks I also only eat from 11 to 19 o'clock.

If our body were a car, good nutrition would be the equivalent high octane fuel and a good night’s rest would be that of a pit stop. I’m sure all you car fanatics could relate to that. Take away good fuel and you end up with a messed up engine in a few years. Take away pit stops and you’re eventually going to see smoke rising out of your car bonnet. Bottom line is, it’s essential.

I don’t mean to play the devil, but I’m afraid I have to break it to you. Spending two hours at the gym is no excuse for binging on a pack of cookies for dinner. ‘But it’s okay to eat junk if you do an hour of cardio, right?’ No! Who ever said that? Let me get this straight. Training does have its place, but without the right nutrition and rest, you are not getting anywhere. Now, I am not telling you to eat like a patient for the rest of your life. What I’m going to throw light upon via this eBook is the importance of adequate rest and proper nutrition as a part of your fitness lifestyle.

“Counting calories? Who wants to live like that?” I’d always say.
Turns out, I DO.
After HATING keto, like hating it (please don’t burn me at the stake you religious keto obsessed mob...) I downloaded MyFitnessPal.
I put in my goals and was pretty upset to be told... 1200 calorie diet.
“Whatever, I’ll leave the goal as is and just track everything and do my best.”
I have learned a ridiculous amount about nutrition in the last three weeks, along with losing 3 pounds, no exercise except dog walks. Just three weeks of trying my best, watching the food go in my mouth, and observing what the reports had to say about my choices.
Here were the huge takeaways, and why I am *so grateful* I finally pulled my head out of my ass and faced the facts.

1. Low carb means low calories. Carbs are dense. If you take them out, your calories go down. If you plan your day a little, which quickly becomes an autopilot thing, you can eat bread and potatoes etc. I’m not talking about keto, I’m talking low carb.

2. Protein is hard to get, and I wasn’t eating even half of what I needed.

3. Eating enough protein changes everything! You don’t feel hungry. Mentally, I feel better. I wish I’d known this would improve my energy levels so much.

4. Getting enough iron from food is ridiculously difficult. I am eating a can of oysters and a Hefty portion of liver pate a day - on my very low calorie diet, I just don’t have enough space to meet the very very high recommended intake for women if I don’t. If anyone has any suggestions, please tell me. Especially heme iron.

5. I would have NEVER been able to accomplish this without MyFitnessPal, which is FREE!

I used to be 123 lbs and am a 5'6, 22 F. 

I have been on my journey for a year and a half and have gone down to 129 but am up to 137 lbs due to breaking my eating habits and not working out (I should blame quarantine but only have myself to blame). I have an insatiable appetite and am struggling to go below 130 lbs. My goal is to get back to my original 123 lbs. My ultimate goal is to get to 115 lbs but will be happy just to be in the 120-130 lbs range (this is a perfectly healthy weight for me).

I am constantly hungry and have tried everything. I have tried drinking more water or zero calorie drinks, eating large amounts of low calorie snacks in between meals. I have tried eating smaller meals in larger intervals. However, all I can think about is food and it's driving me nuts. If I do eat, I feel disgusting after, and bloat to an enormous size.

I am trying to workout again. Even while working out I would not surpass 2000 calories as I need to be in a calorie deficit. Right not I'm eating 1500 calories and incorporating 1-2 hours of walking and high intense 40 min to an hour aerobics coupled with weight lifting. 

I do not want to bulk up, I just want to get a bit leaner and loose excess fat thats built up around my stomach and thighs (pear shape over here). People tell me to gain muscle I need to eat more but I don't believe it. It's calories in and calories out and am close to having 25-30% body fat content. 

It's not even the fact that I am tired or have low energy. I just want to eat! Chew and swallow some food. Idk why it is.

My questions, can anyone recommend me anything? I have definitely reached my plateau weight and don't want to give up again. The weight does not drop off easily after reaching 130-140.

This has really worked great for me so far, in terms of cutting back on eating out/eating fast food, and I feel better &amp; have lost some weight. But now I want to evaluate the meal plan.

The typical meal consists of the following:

6 oz of meat (grilled chicken, steak, ground turkey, grilled tilapia)

6 oz of carb (diced potatoes - either red or sweet)

6 oz of vegetables (broccoli, green beans, diced up peppers)

I'll generally have two of these meals a day, and then either skip a third meal, or have something light for breakfast like some yogurt/fruit, or occasionally a bagel. My main goal right now is to lose weight, and a secondary goal is to build muscle. 

What do you guys think? Am I setting myself up for success? I'm a little concerned I might have too many carbs."
1823,diet,"So what’s this Paleo diet all about? Would it help me? (17M) I am 17 Years old, I weigh about 180lbs, and I am 5’10”. I have access to hunting, wild foraging and fishing. Would this be something I should look into? 

I have good core strength but don’t workout at all, I am just over weight for my BMI of 25.8. I’m just curious because I’ve been hearing a lot about it.

My main diet for the past couple years has been: meat, vegetables, and dairy for most of my meals, I rarely eat fruit, and I have recently been eating a lot of junk food.

Any help/suggestions would be great, thank you!"
1824,diet,"Is my diet considered unhealthy? (For a college student) Breakfast: banana and small hot chocolate

Lunch: cherries, 2 eggs, half a bagel with cream cheese somedays. Tuna or green smoothie somedays.

Dinner: varies but can range from crab and shrimp to burger or chicken fingers with veggies

Dessert: a cookie or small 1/2 cup of ice cream

Edit: I am 5'7, 21 years old and weigh 125. I run most days and am training to lose a bit of weight so I count my calories (which I find more effective while still eating what I want without restriction) Stopping drinking while in college because of all the calories in alcohol."

1826,diet,"Eating lean on a vegan diet? Im a younger male, age of 22. I've been vegan for a long time but only recently got into fitness. I have lost a lot of weight, and i'm not really heavy at all anymore but I want to maintain a lean but fit physique.

My knowledge on a healthy lean vegan diet is pretty lacking and could use any advice. I'm not very picky on what I eat I just don't enjoy cooking too much (if it's something that takes a while to make). I'm not looking to get ""ripped"" or ""big"" I just want to have a leaner appearance. Any advice someone can give me would be greatly appreciated. Especially wondering how important protein is if im not bulking, should I still aim to consume a ton? Such as 1g/per pound I weigh? Thanks again."

1828,diet,"Am I Actually ""Intermittent Fasting""? I have been having a lot of success with keto, but now I have plateaued around 190-195 lb. I have always done ""intermittent fasting"" whilst on keto -- at least I thought I was. Today I questioned that notion. I drink a decent amount of coffee in the mornings (as soon as I get up) with both MCT Oil and Heavy Cream.

I start eating solid food around 1:00-2:00 in the afternoon.

I would love to hear the thoughts of people who are more versed on nutrition than I. I am just beginning. I didn't even know what a carbohydrate was before February 2020. Therefore, please forgive me if my question is obvious. I just am trying to get results.

1831,diet,"Keep getting cravings/hungry in the evening Hey so I'm new to dieting and have cut down from 1500-3000 calories per day to roughly 1500(1800 on days I exercise). I only started two days ago but throughout the day I will snack on one or two things which is fine as I don't approach my limit.

When it gets to around 7pm after eating I get serious food cravings mainly for sweet things like ice cream and chocolate biscuits etc..

I know I have been halfing my intake so it might take a bit to adjust but I just keep feeling so hungry is there anything I can do to help the cravings?"
1832,diet,"Why is my diet so expensive to maintain? So I just got back from shopping and I had spent almost 300$ on almost every single ingredient suggested to me on [here](https://i.imgur.com/N05f8tN.png) which was a site that I used to generate my meal plan for one of those days. I don't think it'd be as bad as I did if the serving sizes weren't so bad. Or rather, the amount of certain ingredients that I am required to use can be half of the package or maybe even more sometimes. Like that $17.30 that I spent on that 1 pound steak. Well, if I was to use 8 ounces per meal and had that same meal 2 days in a row, I would only be able to get 2 days out of that $17 steak. In other words, I'd have to buy a new 17$ steak every two days in order to always have more steak. That 17$ hit every two days adds up. And there are many other examples like that. So I was wondering how I can keep my keto diet going without breaking the bank. Because it feels like it's way more expensive overall to eat healthy than it is to just, not eat healthy, you know? I'm not saying I'm not committed, just that it's gonna be hard for me to afford such a diet if it costs this much, especially considering I just spent close to $300 on the groceries today.

Also another thing that happens is that some of the recipes will specify large eggs and some of them will specify extra large eggs so that also means that I have to buy a dozen eggs in both sizes which is even more money as well."
