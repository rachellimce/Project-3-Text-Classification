Googling doesn’t help because different sites give advice. How do I get back my weight and get my healthy body back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you guys could help.&lt;/p&gt;

Second, we’re Asian so there’s a lot of rice and carbs, once again this is out of my control so becides reducing it, I can’t do much about it. And third, I’m 152cm (5’0) which is really short so that instantly means that my metabolism is slower than an average person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counting calories did not end well for me at all so that’s out of the question. I want it to be effective and sustainable. I can’t trust what those “healthy gurus” say anymore since their advice seems very general and geared towards older or taller people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to be impossible to lose weight for me specifically. It’s like I was born to be unfit. What am I ACTUALLY supposed to do?&lt;/p&gt;

,diet,"Tl;dr at the bottom— post is a bit of a word salad and I’m sorry

Hey guys, 

I’ll just cut right to the chase. About a year ago I began suffering a pretty intense mental break, and have since been diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar type disorder and sort of gave up on life. I gained 60 pounds and was a paranoid, delusional mess up until quarantine kind of began. 

I had a pretty great talk with my uncle and he told me that even suffering is a valuable experience and since then I’ve began working out substantially and even joined a boxing gym. My resting heart rate has gone from 76 bpm to 64 and I’m losing weight like crazy. 

My only issue is this: I’m burning so many calories a day that psychotic symptoms start to manifest again presumably because of the deficit— the brain works in a very top-down sort of way. 

So my question is, since I’m burning around 4000 calories a day, and plan on pursuing boxing as a form of discipline and self mastery. That being said, what should I be eating? What macros and micros should I focus on? It’s a ton of cardio, and I really don’t know much about anything. I’m sorry if this is all over the place, and if this isn’t the right place to post this but any help literally transfers into mental well being. I will try anything. Thank you all so much.

I am however still hoping to lose 30lbs more to be at least on my healthy BMI weight.
I’m very picky when it comes to food, I don’t eat all kinds of veggies and fruits. I try to eat more fruits but not much on berries. I’m Asian so rice is part of our staple meal, although I only eat rice about 1-2 x /week.
I don’t exercise a lot but I do carry my son on a baby carrier or his stroller and take a walk about 1-2x/week for at least 30 mins to an hour.
Is there anything else that I could do to help my weight go down more?
I exclusively breastfeed at least 7x on a 24 hr period lasting 20-45 mins per feeding, if that helps.

Hey all,
I was put on a diet/lift plan a week and a half ago for shredding (burning fat and maintaining/slowly building muscle). I ran my macros by my nutritionist friend and he said the plan that I’m on is gonna hurt me in the long run.

I’m 5 foot 9, 160lbs, 4 years of lifting experience, and 21 years old
The diet plan I’m on is 160-170g protein, 200g carbs, and 60-70g fat.
The lifting plan is 10 min cardio after each lift, 30 min cardio on the three rest days that i have. The remaining 4 days are for the muscle groups, doing each group once a week with extremely high volume (drop sets).

The diet is doable and the workouts are pretty intense. Although my friend told me that the carb intake is too low and i could be losing muscle in the process due to being in a catabolic state. If this is true, how can i tweak the diet? 

If any experts come across this post I’ll happily elaborate more personally.

But the grim part...so from today and yesterday I ate 7500 calories and am now scared I gained back weight from it and cannot get over it. The 7500 was not in healthy stuff either.

Did I gain any weight from today and yesterday and if so how much?? Could y’all help me with the logic??

I've cut out eggs and cow milk since I'm sure those were some of the main culprits to my stink and although I don't smell as bad as I used to, the smell is definitely still there :( I don't know what to cut out now since I drink only water, eat chips every other week.

I also want to cut out meat from my diet, been wanting to do that for a while now as I read that it can be a cause of my stench. but I also come across plans and meals with meat

The problem I'm running into is that different sources overlap and most of them contain items I don't want to eat. I read too much protein can make me smell bad but another website is saying to have a protein full meal? I'm so confused.

I just want to eat healthier without breaking the bank and be able to lift a couple weights as well since I am incredibly lanky.

i was wondering if there might be a subreddit or resource, where i, or any person, can explain their lives and eating habits, the resources they have in their lives and the challenges they face losing weight,

i have found that when speaking to other people about weight loss, i have to explain in great detail my personal financial and lifestyle situation, and that due to poverty, i don't have all the resources and possibilities another person might have.

In my personal life that i have some unique challenges that come with living in poverty that i have to work around and i think that it might be a good idea to try to explain to people what my challenges are, and once they understand what my challenges are, they can start suggesting lifestyle changes that are within my actual reach.

Will my body begin to change (get in better shape/toned) JUST BECAUSE of the new foods I'm eating?

Is it more about calories? As in... Could changing my diet drastically from my original diet to my current diet (above ^) have no change to my physique AT ALL just because I'm still consuming a similar number of calories as before?

But then when I checked the scale the next morning, although I still looked good, I weighed 139.5 gaining 2 pounds back of the 3 I lost.

,diet,"Hey guys, 

I'm 23 years old/male. 6ft tall and weigh around 74kg of cookie dough.

I'm attempting to lose around 4kg, but my weight just does not seem to budge and I'm not sure why at all, as I feel like I'm eating in a calorie deficit and fighting against a massive appetite. One thing to note is that I am in a severe vitamin D deficit; would this impact fat loss at all?
Here's what I eat on a daily basis:
*3x slices of toast [70 kcal ea] with 3 whole eggs
*2x packs of instant oatmeal [35g packs, at around 130 kcal per pack]
*1/2 bag of 125g pack of rice with 125g chicken breast [raw weight] and 100g frozen vegetables
*1x fruit [Peach/Banana/Apple/Pear] with 1 small yoghurt [Normally the Alpro soy ones, sometimes I get Activia ones, roughly 100 calories per small pot]
*3x rice cakes [25 kcal each] with 30g peanut butter.

I feel the portions are adequately small for me to be in a deficit, as I don't imagine that it all adds up to more than 1800 calories, yet my body does not change at all. If anything I feel like my stomach is constantly bloated and I lack energy, which I've felt for a very long time. Aside from being vitamin D deficient I've no health issues.

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the keto diet works, briefly. But, I will be dropping this diet wholeheartedly and attempting another form of weight loss diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve attempted to post this on the Keto thread, but they only take &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot; stories and resort no questions posted on their thread.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm 20 years old and quite tall, I think I'm 180 cm (5ft 9) and 63 kilos(138 pounds), I was 67 before, which is considered normal but I think I have a lot of fat stored in my stomach area and upper arms🤧 I always wanted to diet but never succeeded, and then found CICO and volume eating. 

Now that I am aware how many calories is in everything, and portion sizes and how much my body needs, I am honestly super surprised I'm not morbidly obese by now, bc all my life I'm eating for 2 and a half people. Well until recently anyway. 

I'm just really curious where it was all going?? I wasn't very active aswell, was walking everyday but nothing much really. Now that I have a few bad days I can physically feel bigger and even my measurements go up a bit.

,diet,"Hey guys so I'm a 21 male at 5'7 and 155 lb. Recently I've been really into losing weight and getting lean muscle mass during quarantine. I have a lot of questions so sorry if it seems excessive but I was hoping to get some help. Right now I am practicing intermittent fasting and trying to lose weight. I saw a lot of benefits of intermittent fasting so I thought I would I would give it a go but I realized I was already doing it without knowing so. Because of quarantine, I've been consistently sleeping at 3am-5am and waking up 11am-1pm. I would usually eat about an hour after waking up and eating dinner around 7-8pm. Only two meals a day. I noticed that during quarantine that I would eat small meals and I would be completely satisifed. This was really bizarre to me because back in high school to my first year of college i would be able to eat like crazy. Lately even before quaratine I just haven't been eating. I thought it was just that I was getting ""old"" but I've been doing research on BMR, TDEE and I noticed that for my weight, height and age, I should be eating around 2500 calories to maintain weight and eat at a deficit for weight loss, but not below my BMR which is around 1700. I'm a pretty active guy and used to play basketball 3-4 days during the school year for a couple hours. Lately and have been doing HIIT exercises and resistance band workouts 1 hour a day. So what caught me off guard was that I noticed that I would only eat maybe around 1400 calories total in my two meals and I would be perfectly okay. Online people are saying that the amount if unhealthy for me and that I should increase my calorie count but I feel very full eating more.

,diet,"Hi guys, wondering if any of you can give me some diet advise I can pass along to my father (70M).

He's 5'7"" maybe 150 pounds and is very active. He plays tennis several times a week, rides his bike around town and has recently been training to complete a challenging mountain climb this November. He is a very light eater and I'm pretty certain that his newest workout regiment is putting him at a calorie deficiency (he says he's loosing weight). 

The thing I need for you guys to understand when you give me recommendations is these changes, in order for them to take hold, will have to be minimally invasive to his current life. He's old you know and too large a change will spook him off the idea of a proper diet. 

From a little bit of research I found the lean proteins in seafood could be a good place to start. It's hard though to find specific advice for an active older man on the internet so I've come to you guys. What are some other ideas like this? 

He might not be completely adverse to doing a protein shake. What brand/nutrients does he need to look for?

I appreciate the advise. I'll take links to any articles, recipes, nutritional products, etc. you think will be helpful too.

I researched how long effects of it can last and it said up to two weeks its day 7 now and the symptoms get lesser everyday also
, Luckily Ive dealt with Anxiety pretty much since 13 ( 22 now ) so i know how to handle it &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone one else have similar experiences cutting down on processed sugars ?&lt;/p&gt;

,diet,"Hi, thanks anyone with time to give attention.

My (33) and my gf (25) are a little out of shape, and 2 months and 20 days ago started some ""internet diets"".  

First four days was a diet where all we can eat was a vegetable soup (with some fruit variations depending on the day). And was great, but she developed  nausea just with the smell of the soup. Here each one lose aroung 4-5kg (8-11 pounds)

Next 30 days was a ""lowcarb"" diet, with 100g cabs maximum per day. Not only lowcarb, we've adopted the ""intermittent fasting"", where you eat only during 8h of your day. She still keep eating very less then her ""normal"" would eat, and i'm eating same or more. In this period i lost more 4-5kg and she nothing. 

Then I convince her to go in a nutritionist, but in the session she talked about ""eat better"", and not in wheigh loss. So she got an helthy diet and started home-working-out with youtube home traning like Chloe Ting challenge.

Of course, I'm on board and keep the trainings with her, and 30 days later I'm lost some weight and she kept in the same as 60 days ago. 

I can not believe in her absence of results. I'm follow her effort and everytime she get up in the balance, i can feel her going down, and my hearth cries with her everytime. I even started eating trash food behind her to stop some of my results, but they keep coming even so.

Any sugestions? Maybe a change of nutritionist? Should we get her a doctor to see why? Please, any ideas?

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve come back this week and now I weigh 87kg. I&amp;#39;m really not sure what happened or how I could put on 8kg in one week. I know scales can fluctuate up to 3kg difference either way, but that&amp;#39;s still an extra 5kg more than I expected. My body looks a bit bigger than usual, maybe 2 kg heavier than before I took a week off, but definitely not back to how it looked at 87kg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to wonder how accurate scales are, and if I should even be weighing myself and instead just doing what my gut says. Is there another more consistent, accurate way to see if a diet is working?&lt;/p&gt;

,diet,"Hi everyone! 
First post here and I'm hoping it's the right place.

I'm (22f) 5""5 and last I checked I was around 60/62kg with a BMI of 22.5.

My job is fairly physical and I walk anywhere between 6 to 12 miles 5 to 6 days a week as well as carrying and lifting various weights throughout. 

My frame is fairly small with muscular legs and arms but my stomach is refusing to slim down. 

Until recently, I would eat 600/800cal at work and then pig out on a lot of snacks and a large meal at night.

For the past 3 weeks, I've been eating more calories at work (around 1000 minimum) with food containing wholegrain, veg, chicken and a little fat. 

I've been feeling really full recently so have stopped snacking (for the most part) but it feels like I've been eating so much more and going over my recommended calories, yet I feel like my stomach/waist is getting smaller and feeling slightly more toned.

Is this a normal reaction to eating a lot more fibre?

Thanks in advance!

The only thing that makes me occasionally break and just give up on it is the questions. I don’t know wether or not I should make sure everything, lunch to dinner, has low sugar etc. I don’t know if too much natural sugar is bad. Another main problem is I work out a lot and like protein bars before and after workouts. However I can’t actually find any that have zero sugar. This is making me wonder if I’m taking the no sugar thing too serious and if you’re meant to occasionally have some stuff that has a few grams in it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

,diet,"So I am just starting this and trying to figure out the right schedule. Here’s what I know about what works for me. I am not a big breakfast person. I honestly just started eating breakfast awhile ago since my workout increased. So I think only eating between 11-7or 12-8 will work for me.

Also, I like working out first thing in the morning. I usually jog 50-70 minutes and then do a low impact workout.  I have been doing this for years and my body is used to it, more of a mental health thing for me and keeping in shape to keep up with the sports I play. I am also training for a half marathon so I know those longer days that I am increasing my distance, I am not doing IF and eating my usual light breakfast.

I have been doing this for years and my body is used to it, more of a mental health thing for me and keeping in shape to keep up with the sports I play.

My desserts have been peaches and milk and ice in the blender.

I've been using sea salt for months, not realizing that iodine is necessary for your Thyroid. Last month I realized that bit, so I switched to idodized salt, but kept eating the same diet, hoping my issues stemmed from diet.

,diet,"hi
I'm trying to lose weight and I'm doing a decent enough job at it. lost 30 kg before i injured my arm and then came Corona. now i gained back some and i need a plan.
i go to the gym 3 times a week and i have a pretty good idea of what to eat. i have some weaknesses that are keeping me down and i just can't find anyone or anywhere to help me with these realistically.

my biggest issue is i grew up with a single student mom and later struggled with unemployment. we never had that much and it taught me to grab as much as i can whenever there was something good.

this means i over indulge whenever stuff just lies around. i just can't help it. i will f'im eat it. i can bypass this when i do grocery shopping because I'm pretty disciplined that way. somehow chocolate cake loses its appeal when i have to pay for it. this works very well and i cook good meals but at work we have this snack cupboard with the worst shit in it. it's free and i can't get past it, especially because I pass the cupboard a couple of times a day.

i can say no once, twice. but walk me by a free Snickers bar three times, I'll eat it.

,diet,"A friend suggested that I should make a post about a weird/unique thing I have went through all of my life and I thought it was a good idea to share this story and answer any questions you may have about it. 

Little backstory: I'm 22 years old from the UK and the only liquid's which have ever entered my body are breast milk (as a baby lol), medicines such as a Calpol, cough medicine and Plain Water. I've always been curious to see if there was anyone else who has had the same situation as me, and I've came across a lot of people who have said ""i only drink water too"" but never found someone who has actually went their life without a single flavoured drink. I would assume there are people who have in 3rd world countries where water is literally their only available source but other than that I'm not too sure.

As a child I was always physically sick at the sight and smell of drinks other than water and could never even imagine trying them. Being in reception (kindergarten for Americans) there would be a tray of juice for the whole class and then one single cup which was water which would be mine, over the years people would always ask me to try knew things but there was never any logical reason for me to do so, I was always completely satisfied with just water. 

I was never tempted by any other drink, however, I am at the point now where I am very curious to see how my body/mind would react to a shot(s) of straight Vodka.

&lt;p&gt;Little backstory: I&amp;#39;m 22 years old from the UK and the only liquid&amp;#39;s which have ever entered my body are breast milk (as a baby lol), medicines such as a Calpol, cough medicine and Plain Water. I&amp;#39;ve always been curious to see if there was anyone else who has had the same situation as me, and I&amp;#39;ve came across a lot of people who have said &amp;quot;i only drink water too&amp;quot; but never found someone who has actually went their life without a single flavoured drink. I would assume there are people who have in 3rd world countries where water is literally their only available source but other than that I&amp;#39;m not too sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a child I was always physically sick at the sight and smell of drinks other than water and could never even imagine trying them. Being in reception (kindergarten for Americans) there would be a tray of juice for the whole class and then one single cup which was water which would be mine, over the years people would always ask me to try knew things but there was never any logical reason for me to do so, I was always completely satisfied with just water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never tempted by any other drink, however, I am at the point now where I am very curious to see how my body/mind would react to a shot(s) of straight Vodka. It would be going from the most mild drink to the most extreme. I&amp;#39;ve never understood how alcohol can alter someone&amp;#39;s brain so much and I&amp;#39;m curious to see how it would affect me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m to break my streak at some point I will definitely write another post about it.&lt;/p&gt;

,diet,"Hello! I'll try to be brief but also contextualize.

A couple of months ago I started to eat healthier as I realized clothes didn't fit as they used to. I asked a couple of friends for advice on meals since I'm not good at cooking. I came up with this ""diet"" which I like. I'm a 25 year old male, 5'3"" and weight approximately 143 pounds. 

It has worked, I've lost weight in 3 months. I can't tell how much, since in my mind, it was about eating better more than anything, so I never weighed myself.  

I exercise, now more than when I began. As of now, I'm exercising 3-4 times a week for about 45-60 minutes. That's mostly cardio since I don't own weights (and prices spiked since covid-19). I jump rope for about 15 minutes, 15 minutes of jogging in place, and the rest on various exercises such as high stepping, jumping jacks, core exercises, squats, etc.  

I've been eating, almost everyday, oats and eggs for breakfast, shredded skinless chicken and a mixture of cooked vegetables for dinner. For lunch, it varies since I eat at my job's restaurant, and here is where I thought most of my calories came from, but always on the realm of healthy.  Of course, every other day I've had sandwiches, patties,  what you would call a cheat meal on a weekend, some cookies in a morning etc. So I haven't deprived myself of anything.

I became interested in learning how many calories I consumed after reading an article about how drastically cutting calories was bad. And to my surprise I roughly eat between 1400 and 1700 a day, which if I'm correct fits in ""drastically"". 

I've never felt unusually hungry, I've never felt like I can't do my exercises, or lack of energy, and haven't had trouble sleeping, etc. 

Now, should I worry? I don't want to slow down my metabolism or cause weight gain in the long run. Should I eat more? 

I also am planning on buying weights to add to my exercises, and I'm worried that maybe I'm eating too little.

Recently I have begun to track my caloric intake to discover what I already assumed was true. I simply don’t eat enough to sustain the muscle growth I seek, and the things I do eat are by no means what constitute healthy weight gain.

I believe my main problem is that I do not know how to cook, nor what foods to get to start learning to cook, so I am left with whatever my parents get which is typically frozen garbage that’s slowly killing me.


So I ask, not for meals plans or anything of the sort. I simply ask, from the perspective I’ve given you, what you believe my best step forward is. I need to eat more, better, foods, yes, but I ask for your advice on how I might get there.

,diet,"Hello everyone,

I’d like to ask some questions. Here’s some context. 

I’m a 21 year old male, about 5’9. Two years ago I was 155lbs. A year ago I was 176lbs, this past May I got as low as 153lbs. Today I am 160lbs. Still, however, I don’t have a slim face, or a slim waist. My belly still hung out and my waist had a lot of fat on it when I was 153lbs. 

The way I lost all this weight was by intermittent fasting. Started with the 16 hour fast, then got to 18 hour fast, but still overall making healthier foods choices (still some junk food though). 

My weight is good for my size and age, I’m not overweight. If you saw me, you’d think I’m slim. However, when I take my shirt off I look fat. Why can’t I lose the weight on my waist and face?

Another question I have is about my diet right now. I’ve been doing an 18 hour fast everyday for 8 days now. I have a Small Iced Cappucino (horrible addiction) and scrambled eggs with two slices of bread everyday at 3PM. Then, around 8PM, I have dinner (big meal, 70% meat, 20% carbs, 10% veges). 

I know the iced capp is really bad. If I keep doing this, will I even lose weight? I feel like I have to get down to at least 145lbs to have a slim face/waist.

,diet,"Hey guys! Hope this is allowed here. I've been with my girlfriend for over 3 years now and for the most part things are great. But one of the biggest problems I have is her pickiness. We both want to try some kind of diet soon but i have no idea how to coordinate that with her.

 Me, I LOVE vegetables. I will eat anything short of a few specific peppers and big chunks of onion. My girlfriend likes green beans, corn, and broccoli. And I wish I could say that's not all. She will occasionally snack on celery so long as its doused in lemon pepper. No lettuce, tomatoes (I know it's a fruit dont @ me lol), onions of any kind, peppers, none of it. And it doesnt just end there. She likes almost exclusively fried food or food that's filled with sugar.

I'm not trying to play god or anything over here, my diet leaves a lot to be desired as well but that's why I want to change that. But I dont know how to transition to a diet when you could pull up any ""healthy"" food and she'll find something about it she doesn't like. I dont want her to be miserable eating scraps of food because she doesn't like the meals I make for dinner and I'd never put her in that position. I want us to start exercising soon but if we're keeping the same diet we have now that's not going to mean a whole lot if we're actually trying to lose weight. 

So I guess I'm just looking for advice. I don't want to believe that its just an incompatibility thing because short of our opinions on food we get along great and love each other a lot, hence why we've stayed together so long. Are there any picky eater friendly diets she could try? Is expanding her palate the only option? We also drink a lot of soda, would cutting out sugar entirely be good enough even if she continues with the occasional fried foods and minimum veggies?

,diet,"Hello all,

Im hopingI can possibly gain some insight on why my physical weight is stalling for weeks at a time during my routine. A brief synopsis about me and my routine:

I am a beginner who has been consistently working out for about 4 months now. While I have worked out many times throughout my life, this is by far the most consistent I have ever been. I would have been classified as ""skinny fat"" when I started. I weighed 230 lbs at 6'2 at my heaviest, and over the course of semi dieting and working out for 3 of those 4 months I got down to 215 lbs, while also gaining what looks like a decent amount of muscle.

I decided to really dive in with my diet since I am working out so hard. So I came up with 2,400 calories 40/40/20, based on a calculator I used on Legions website. Ive been hitting this consistently, and frankly I feel awesome on it. I am never full, and always slightly hungry but I enjoy that. With that combined with a 6 day PPL routine I have made it down to 210 lbs in the last 30 days.

So the issue I am having. I have been stuck at 209-210.8 lbs for almost a week and a half now. I am looking better, my weights are continuing to progress, I am constantly hungry, energy is relatively high, etc. I cant imagine I need to reduce more from a caloric perspective. Im either at the gym for my PPL or doing cardio on my off days, and I do the Sauna almost daily. However since I work from home, once Im done with this I am fairly sedentary the remainder of the day.

Is it possible I am going muscle in place of fat and thats why the scale isn't moving? I know this is possible but I didn't think I would stall like this, which is what happened once I hit 215 lbs also. Any recommendations on what to do?

I can provide more information if needed also.

I am losing weight very quickly and even on days I eat the most I'm at a 20% deficit or more

My goal is to cut 30 more lbs then start slow bulking.  I want to know a few things:

I hit my protein requirements but my carbs never exceed more  than 50g a day. Will adding rice, pasta  help or hinder me?
Will the fattier cuts of meat and egg yolk I eat  slow my weight loss down?
Do I need supplements with my restrictive diet?
At what times should I consuming carbs, fats and proteins ?
Should my meals be the same on rest days?

,diet,"Hi Everyone,

Wanted to get some advice on calories per day.  Long story short.  I'm 5'9, 29 year old male.  About a year and half ago I weighed 285-300 lbs depending on water weight.  I've since lost about 100 lbs, and now weight between 190 - 200, depending on water weight. 

Long story short, I know that's a cool accomplishment, but its really done nothing for me in terms of self-confidence, dating apps, etc.  I wallowed around a little feeling sorry for myself, but I realize now I just need to keep putting in more work. 

In any event, my goal was to get to 170-175, but I'm realizing that just losing weight isn't going to help me with woman at all, so I'm signed up to start seeing a personal trainer 5x a week--starting tomorrow. 

Here is the actually question:  I currently eat about 1250 calories a day. I \*think\* the trainer is going to want me to start eating more, and I'm comfortable, to an extent, eating a little more. But I never want to look a pound fatter than I look today. Any advice on calories per day.  If I keep eating 1250, am I destroying any chance at making lean muscle gains? 

Also, I'm concerned about adding muscle under my abdominal fat, and looking fatter.

Note, I know their are important nutrition items besides calories. I want to work on that also, but right now this is all from a sense of vanity, so I'm really focused on the calories and appearance aspect, because that is having the biggest impact on my mental health right now.

I'll give some breif backstory

\-Kid-18:  Competitive athelete, fit, but with a spare tire or two. Always jealous of the skinnier folks. Tried dieting but never had the willpower.

\-Age 19-29.  College and adulthood both result in  Not as many sports or working out.  Much more beer, much worse diet.  Starting to become more self conscious during this period.  Tried to diet so so so many times, never ever lasts. (WEIGHT- 200ish)

\-Age 29-30.  Cocaine and bad decisions.  Weight from 200ish to about 165.

\-Age 31-32.  Quit cocaine replaced with food. Weight back to 210 ish.

Today:  Weight 181

&amp;#x200B;

That brings us to today.  I  lost my job due to COVID, and I said to myself, buddy, you can't sit on your ass eating here.  and I vowed to lose the weight. That was 2 months ago.

I'm down over 20 pounds already and I feel amazing. I'm sitting at 181.

I've had a horrible relationship with food my whole life.  I struggled to stay under 3000 calories a day.  After a week or so of struggling with my most recent attempt (which I was gunning for 1800 calories a day), something clicked and now it's super easy.

I'm *easily* able to stay under 1000 calories a day.  It's not something I target but it has happened numerous times. I'm taking a multivitamin for men, B12, and what I am eating is usually pretty healthy (lots of veggies/fish).

I haven't lost my appetite either-  I was at a special event last week and ate quite a lot, and had no problem finishing a plate my mom had prepared for me for dinner at my parents house, which was my normal portion size.

I have successfully changed my relationship with food, I don't know how, but my main question is if I have to worry about my health in terms of not eating enough, aside from what my body tells me to do.

I honestly can't believe I am eating so little, as I am doing a birsk hour long walk per day, and spending at least 10 hours a day in the house standing up (much of that time playing with a medicine ball).  For what its worth that is the *only* exercise I have done to lose all this weight.

Another main concern is that I am going to lose some of my muscle mass if I keep this up.  Is that likely to happen quicker than I lose the fat?  As I said I am using a medicine ball to work the core/upper body and doing lots of walking for lower, and nearly everything I eat is high in protien.

,diet,"Hi, I'm doing a 16:8 Intermittent fasting routine. I'm also maintaining a caloric deficit to lose weight. I'm about 5'5"" and I weigh about 187 pounds and I'm in my mid twenties. My concern is that I'm a vegetarian and a lot of my protein sources end up being slightly high in carbohydrates.

,diet,"My daily diet

Goodday folks. Been on this diet for a couple of weeks now, and while I feel fine (although peckish), I do wonder if I get everything my body needs. I know it works, I lose about half a kilo a week with this. 

I am a man, 42 years old. 1,78 meters tall, I weigh around 71 kg's.  I work out about five times a week. Fitness and bouldering. I'm trying to shed some kg's to help me boulder. 

Please let me know if I miss something essential.

Breakfast.

Two wholewheat breadslices with a smoked herring filet between or a smoked mackerel filet (about 80 grams). Chopped onion on top. A pointy pepper, and usually a carrot or a piece of cucumber. Always a kiwi and some other fruit, whatever is in season. 2 cups of strong black coffee.

Lunch.

Two wholewheat breadslices with some ham and cheese in between. Or a hardboiled egg. A fruit. A carrot and some cucumber.

Snack.

A fruit.

Dinner.

Usually between 300 and 400 grams of vegetable (can be anything, cabbage, leeks, spinach, endives, whatever is in season), around 120/140 grams of meat (chicken, turkey or pork) and around 150 grams of various beans, chickpeas or lentils. I stirfry these ingredients with a homemade currypaste, or a mixture of soy and fish sauce steeped in ginger and other spices. I like to experiment with those. I eat a lot of garlic.

Snack.

A hand of nuts and a fruit.

I'll have a beer now and then. Other than that it is coffee, green tea or just plain water.

,diet,"I've got no weight problems, I'm a 180 cm tall male weighing 76 kg. I'm no expert on the subject but I feel very average.

I have a condition however which doesn't do me any harm beyond not letting me know when I'm hungry or full until I'm at an extreme. I have alarms to let me know when to eat, and if I don't I start to feel extremely dizzy and then that's how I can tell I'm hungry.

Everytime I try to diet hunger pangs make it extremely difficult for me. I am not terribly overweight ( I am around 15 kilos more than I should ) but I definitely want to get more lean.  

As far as nutrition goes I am not mister Healthy but I'd like to say I am doing a decent job at it. I love whole grains, legumes and fruit/veggies ( provided they are in season ). When it comes to meat I hate fatty meat like pork and I love lean meat with chicken and fish being my fav. The only really unhealthy thing for me is when I get crazy sweet urges and I like swallow a candy bar whole or something. 

I am mentioning all these because again I don't think I am super healthy but I think I am doing better than the average man does today. So my biggest problem in losing weight is hunger pangs. I will give you an example for today. 

I ate 2 hours ago a sandwich that included arabic bread, chicken, cheese, tomatoes and letuce. A perfect meal right? after 2 hours my stomach was screaming ( hunger pangs ) and I had to shut it up with food again.

&lt;li&gt;How would protein powders and such be able to help me? What would the use of them be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you &amp;quot;stick to it&amp;quot;. Quitting cold turkey is one thing but I did that with soda and besides the urge for sugar and caffeine a few times and me just drinking water everyday, what should I do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Reddit members for assisting me.&lt;/p&gt;

I started my keto journey way back in May. However because I lack any and all willpower it took me up until about this week to fully commit. With that being said Monday &amp; Tuesday of this week I did eat some fruits, and a very small amount of candy. But other than that it’s been no sugar, &amp; no carbs for me. I have also kept my calorie intake at about 1000 calories a day and I’ve also been walking 5 miles a day which have been burning 800-1000 calories a night. On Monday morning I weighed in at 279 lbs, and this morning I weighed in at 269 lbs. I read somewhere that rapid weight loss is the first sign of ketosis, but since I had fruit and candy Monday and Tuesday I have reasons to doubt that. 

My questions are:

1. Am I in ketosis
2. If I’m not in ketosis would what would cause that rapid weight loss
3. If I had a cheat day or two (which I know is forbidden) would it cause me to gain it all back in a day or 2? Believe me I want some pizza tonight!!

I know I said I had a ton of questions and I feel like I still do, but that’s all I can think of right now. So I may still ask more. 

Please help if you can.

,diet,"Hello fellow dieters of reddit,

I am new to this sub, I have primarily joined this sub as my girlfriend and I recently became pregnant. She is 14 weeks along however she got some news to restrict her diet as she is at risk for gestational diabetes. We have consulted her nutritionist and they have been helpful. However I was wondering if you guys would have any healthy snacks I can simply purchase at the store that are close too as good as the substitue its substituting. Any recipes would also be welcome.

&lt;p&gt;I am new to this sub, I have primarily joined this sub as my girlfriend and I recently became pregnant. She is 14 weeks along however she got some news to restrict her diet as she is at risk for gestational diabetes. We have consulted her nutritionist and they have been helpful. However I was wondering if you guys would have any healthy snacks I can simply purchase at the store that are close too as good as the substitue its substituting. Any recipes would also be welcome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The snack preference according to her nutritionist is 15g of carbohydrate for morning snacks

Hey Everyone!

Quick Backstory.

I (21M) am on a weightloss journey. I used to be very fit; I am a Martial Artist and used to train hard 14+hrs a week on top of other exercise. Then I got some injuries that got me out of training, then I got into a bad place mentally and gained about 20-30lbs. Last weigh a few months ago, I was about 225-230lbs. I'm about 5'11"" but have a decent amount of muscle.  
I've since cut down some weight, but I've never worried about dieting or calorie counting because no matter what I ate, I burned in training. 

I recently got an Apple Watch and saw that I burn anywhere from 3,000-3,600 calories a day. Some weeks I can burn more, it just depends on work and my schedule; I stay very busy.   
I cook a lot for myself (typically Korean food \[thank you grandma\]) so basically chicken or thin steak and rice, or chicken burritos with spinach wraps. 

But in order to lose weight efficiently, I heard I need to create a deficit. What’s a general recommended caloric cut? 
And recipe links y’all could share?


TIA!

TL;DR: I got hurt and gained weight, and currently burn 3,000-3,600 calories a day. Recommended amount of calories to cut to lose weight?

&lt;p&gt;Hey Everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick Backstory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I (21M) am on a weightloss journey. I used to be very fit; I am a Martial Artist and used to train hard 14+hrs a week on top of other exercise. Then I got some injuries that got me out of training, then I got into a bad place mentally and gained about 20-30lbs. Last weigh a few months ago, I was about 225-230lbs. I&amp;#39;m about 5&amp;#39;11&amp;quot; but have a decent amount of muscle.&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve since cut down some weight, but I&amp;#39;ve never worried about dieting or calorie counting because no matter what I ate, I burned in training. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm male, 40 yo, 5'8"", 229.6 lbs.  I was 267.4 on March 7 when I began to work to lose weight and have lost at a steady rate since that time (graph below).  Can't really account for the one week where I spiked as I did nothing different at that time, so chocked it up to randomness.

Currently my diet is essentially the same thing every day:

Breakfast: Naked smoothie (between 210 and 320 calories);

Lunch: Fiber One bar (140 calories) and flavored almonds (170 calories);

Dinner: Just about whatever I want from pizza to Indian to cheesteak (approximatley 800-1000 calories) or, if my wife cooks, something healthier and typically vegan (approximately 600-800 calories);

Snacks: Dove milk chocolate pieces (amounts varying day-to-day) and some kind of ice cream after dinner (total snack calories 400-800 varying day-to-day).

I realize the above can hardly be called a diet for most folks, but it definitely is for me compared to my typical daily intake.

My exercise routine is also roughly the same every day: I walk between 4.5 and 5.5 miles in the morning and 1-3 times a week an additional 1.5-3 miles in the evening.

I'm satisfied with the pace of my weight loss to this point and would like to continue as above until I get down to 190 lbs.  My concern is that I will begin to find it harder and harder to keep pace without cutting out the snacking and/or significantly improving the quality of my dinner intake.

How realistic is it to continue with the above diet and expect to continue to cut weight?  Will I plateau (I weigh weekly and my most recent two weigh-ins were identical to the tenth of a pound)?  Or will I simply keep losing but at a slower rate?

2. They input their menu on the platform and add tags to each menu item that violates certain dietary restrictions.

,diet,"I really want to change my eating time and habits. But I've always run into hurdles. There are times when I can chomp down stuff fast, and others which still linger when I just take a ton of time. I will REALLY appreciate any help anyone can offer/suggest/recommend.

This is to the point where if it feels too much or I take more than 10-15 mins on it, i will end up procrastinating  and take well over an hour to slowly finish it.

I also do NOT eat faster when I am distracted by watching tv or talking. In fact, I get absorbed in those things and end up ignoring my food, to the point where I feel like abandoning it since it feels like such a pain.

I notice I usually chew really slow when this happens and feel like I have less energy to chew. (But not anything else)

I have this feeling in my head, where I just want to be done with the food, as I tend to not be able to multi-task or focus on anything else until my food is dealt with.

I will note that this happens with food that I have control over/cooked myself AND with food that I don't have control over (Gift/restaurant (what comes in the plate n how it is prepared)/at a friend's place).

I find myself needing to use water to get it down, and really dislike 'dry' food in general, like salad, or bread or any dish that is prepared without a liquid or sauce of some kind in it.

I tend to have a far easier time with anything that is remotely like a 'gravy' or otherwise wet. It's not like I don't generate saliva since when I'm faced with food I especially like, my glands are going crazy. They are also totally fine with gravy food.

However, the inevitable dryness/boredom/laziness WILL happen and set in if I get distracted, or if my plate or bowl portion size is relatively big and it feels like 'It will take a lot of effort to chew and oh man, this is gonna take a long time. Geez what a waste of time. I could be doing X,Y and Z right now.' This is EVEN IF I am hungry at the time. It just feels like less energy spent eating it than doing something else.

As far as what I eat, I aim to eat generally very healthy food, greens, fruits and veggies, lean meat(less red) etc. which also probs contribute to making it a chore to eat. I also have supplements and multivitamins etc, which are far easier to 'eat' obv.

&amp;#x200B;

I will note that when I say I want to learn to eat fast, I don't mean in some crazy, unhealthily fast manner, but more to the point of being able to simply sit down, focus and get the food eaten and dealt with.

Finally, while one solution could be to focus on 'just' eating and paying attention to nothing else (like watching tv shows), I want to learn how I can eat fast AND watch things at the same time. If other people can, why can't I? Can I perhaps do it step by step? Learn to eat fast first &gt; work on eating faster while watching stuff?

,diet,"Hi!

My SO and I are trying to calculate our calorie deficits for losing weight. We used the calculator here to calculate it, but before we begin we'd like to get a second opinion about the options this calculator has and the results it has given.

We input our age, weight, gender, height, and body fat as measured by both a physical and electronic caliper. The calipers had slightly different numbers so we met in between.

We input our activity level and here is where we run into our first minor snag. We weren't sure which applied to each of us. Both my SO and I work desk jobs, which is sedentary. My SO does weight training 4-5 days a week for a minimum of 45 minutes, but no cardio. I do strictly light walking for about an hour every other night with some light weight/body weight exercises every other day for under 30 minutes. We weren't sure which one to pick for each of us.

Sedentary has little to no exercise, moderate walking which sounds like me, but I wasn't sure what counter as little to no exercise. I exercise for under 30 minutes, is that considered little exercise or does it fall under Slightly Active?

my SO wasn't sure which to pick because while they thought Moderately Active sounded about right they didn't feel like the 45 minute workout matched up with Construction Laborer. Our confusion may be that the comas separating the descriptions are not all or nothing, but examples of what falls into these categories. For instance, my SO isn't a Construction Laborer, but they do lift weights 4-5 days a week which would fall under Moderately Active correct? Or would they have to lower it to a less active option? If Moderately Active is correct how much time is considered ""Exercise""?

Next was the BMR Methodology, which was auto selected to only Mifflin St Jeor so we left it as is until we asked which would be more appropriate or would a combination of them all be best?

Then we decided we would want to lose about 2 lbs a week which seemed okay, but we weren't sure if it was to much as the maximum amount of weight does have a cap, but its above 2.

Both of our Calorie Intake Targets were under 1,100 calories. Both my SO and I are very short if that matters, I will provide details if needed. We weren't sure if that was safe.

We are also both confused at the color scale with informative messages inside. For instance in one calculations one just said ""UNDER!"" with no information if we run the mouse over it and another said ""WAY OFF"" with a calorie number popup when we run the mouse over it. Does this mean we did something wrong?

Finally, we are doing IF 5 days a week which has our calories even lower then the Calorie Intake Target. Like under 500 calories for me. Is this accurate or should we switch to another calculator.

After speaking with our doctor they only really said, diet is key and that under 1000 a day was bad, but we thought we'd ask here before deciding one way or another.

&lt;p&gt;My SO and I are trying to calculate our calorie deficits for losing weight. We used the calculator here to calculate it, but before we begin we&amp;#39;d like to get a second opinion about the options this calculator has and the results it has given.&lt;/p&gt;

,diet,"So I always knew Mom had disordered eating but boy, I am starting to flip out since she's been living with us for three months. She's home all the time, without a job or friends, and sits in the living room all day (I work from home) knitting. No signs yet on when she can go anywhere else as she gave up her house and is waiting to move in with my sister once borders reopen.

She comments on everything I eat - if it's ""good"", ""bad"", wanting some, judging it. I am overweight, with my dad's stocky body, and she is thin (from her disordered eating and extreme dieting, in my view). I've dealt with this my whole life and it's caused a lot of issues for me, but not directly for so long since I left home at 18. I'm beginning to lose it. I'm now 40 and she is 65!!!!

The thing is, SHE is the one who bakes and brings junk food into the house for the past 3 months. Ice cream, chocolate bars, chips, alcohol (we don't drink much). She regularly bakes cakes, cinnamon buns, sweet biscuits and slices. Then she'll have one and leave them all for me and my husband to eat while she performatively does not eat them.

This is not new. She did body building for a year when I was 25 and baked and baked and gave it away because not eating made her crazy. Now it's like she is still baking and giving it away and getting some thrill out of not eating it and being ""good"". We don't want the food around - we want to eat better. But of course, i'm not going to throw out 4 pints of ice-cream and the chocolate she bought - it's a waste. We have some in the evenings if it's there, although i don't really want it. I am beginning to think I just need to toss it, though.

Literally all she has in her life is food, food judgements, and food avoidance. Every second comment is about food, vegetables good, anything else bad. I can't handle it. I can't get the comments she made as a kid out of my head ""Well, she's had too much McDonald's hasn't me"" she said to me once about the poor cashier, when we were LITERALLY IN LINE AT MCDONALD'S. Saying ""This is 10 points"" before she ate her McFeast burger. All the Weight Watchers, all the Jenny Craig. On and on and on.

These were the comments today ALONE - and keep in mind I avoided her all day (i avoid her as much as possible, it's a tiny house)

* ""You're not making the salad! It's full of condensed milk. So disgusting. That is the worst thing you can eat!"" (I had left an old recipe out that i MIGHT make)
* ""You might as well inject that cheese straight into your arteries"" (It's fucking cheese, chill out)
* ""THAT'S DISGUSTING!"" (me deliberately squirting whipped cream into my mouth from the can to piss her off - SHE bought it) ""NO. STOP IT."" Like it's causing her serious pain.
* Picking at her waistline while sitting at the table, squeezing her roll there and then saying ""I had an ice-cream today and I dropped chocolate on myself. disgusting.""
* Tells my husband to ""Have more"" and help himself, have another serving, while saying nothing of the sort to me (like every meal for six years)
* ""Ugh, i'm so full etc etc etc""

THAT IS ONE DAY, PEOPLE.

I am about to lose my rag big time and don't know what to do. I can't eat without her comments. I can't say anything to her for fear of uncovering this massive issue for her. She's not educated - she doesn't get mindfulness or anything like that. She would just get really upset and make lockdown even more intolerable. I just need some advice on how do i control myself and avoid the negative feelings in myself that her intensive food shaming causes in me. I have a history of disordered eating too - no wonder - and am trying to recover.

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, SHE is the one who bakes and brings junk food into the house for the past 3 months. Ice cream, chocolate bars, chips, alcohol (we don&amp;#39;t drink much). She regularly bakes cakes, cinnamon buns, sweet biscuits and slices. Then she&amp;#39;ll have one and leave them all for me and my husband to eat while she performatively does not eat them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not new. She did body building for a year when I was 25 and baked and baked and gave it away because not eating made her crazy. Now it&amp;#39;s like she is still baking and giving it away and getting some thrill out of not eating it and being &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;. We don&amp;#39;t want the food around - we want to eat better. But of course, i&amp;#39;m not going to throw out 4 pints of ice-cream and the chocolate she bought - it&amp;#39;s a waste. We have some in the evenings if it&amp;#39;s there, although i don&amp;#39;t really want it. I am beginning to think I just need to toss it, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally all she has in her life is food, food judgements, and food avoidance. Every second comment is about food, vegetables good, anything else bad. I can&amp;#39;t handle it. I can&amp;#39;t get the comments she made as a kid out of my head &amp;quot;Well, she&amp;#39;s had too much McDonald&amp;#39;s hasn&amp;#39;t me&amp;quot; she said to me once about the poor cashier, when we were LITERALLY IN LINE AT MCDONALD&amp;#39;S. Saying &amp;quot;This is 10 points&amp;quot; before she ate her McFeast burger. All the Weight Watchers, all the Jenny Craig. On and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the comments today ALONE - and keep in mind I avoided her all day (i avoid her as much as possible, it&amp;#39;s a tiny house)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not making the salad! It&amp;#39;s full of condensed milk. So disgusting. That is the worst thing you can eat!&amp;quot; (I had left an old recipe out that i MIGHT make)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;You might as well inject that cheese straight into your arteries&amp;quot; (It&amp;#39;s fucking cheese, chill out)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;THAT&amp;#39;S DISGUSTING!&amp;quot; (me deliberately squirting whipped cream into my mouth from the can to piss her off - SHE bought it) &amp;quot;NO. STOP IT.&amp;quot; Like it&amp;#39;s causing her serious pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picking at her waistline while sitting at the table, squeezing her roll there and then saying &amp;quot;I had an ice-cream today and I dropped chocolate on myself. disgusting.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tells my husband to &amp;quot;Have more&amp;quot; and help himself, have another serving, while saying nothing of the sort to me (like every meal for six years)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Ugh, i&amp;#39;m so full etc etc etc&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THAT IS ONE DAY, PEOPLE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am about to lose my rag big time and don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I can&amp;#39;t eat without her comments. I can&amp;#39;t say anything to her for fear of uncovering this massive issue for her. She&amp;#39;s not educated - she doesn&amp;#39;t get mindfulness or anything like that. She would just get really upset and make lockdown even more intolerable. I just need some advice on how do i control myself and avoid the negative feelings in myself that her intensive food shaming causes in me. I have a history of disordered eating too - no wonder - and am trying to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have asked her to quit it on making the baked goods in the meantime, but any discussion of wanting to eat better feels like a massive can of worms for her to open and continue to criticise me with.&lt;/p&gt;

,diet,"Hello!  
Recently I lost a lot of weight and managed to achieve my dream body. Now I want to help other manage the same thing.  
The 6 steps I followed which worked for me are the following:  


1. Calculate your calorie expenditure  
– Use a TDEE calculator to calculate your daily energy expenditure.  
– Remove 10-20% for your energy expenditure.  

2. Track your intake  
– Get an app to track your intake.  
– Fill in your energy expenditure.  
– Get a food scale and measure you meals.  
– **Stick to it**  

3. Estimate your bodyfat  
– Estimate what % body-fat you’re at using a caliper, or guessing with a reference chart.  

4. Set your goal  
– Set a date when you’ll have achieved your goal and you’re ready for the beach.  

5. Tracking your weight  
– Write down your current weight every morning.  
– Calculate your weekly average at the end of every week  
– Decrease your intake or increase your workouts when hitting a plateau.  

6. Adapt to your new lifestyle  
– Recalculate your energy expenditure.  
– Go back to maintenance intake.  
– Hold on to your dream body.

If you want to go more in dept I leave a link to my article where I've explained it in more detail.

,diet,"Air pollution has now reached hazardous levels in most of the tier 1 and tier 2 cities in the world. Air pollution (ambient and indoor) kills seven million people every year. Immediate effects of air pollution include **irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue**. Some pollutants can also be the cause of asthma and may aggravate the condition of a person who is already suffering from asthma.  Long-term effects include **respiratory diseases, heart disease and cancer**. These hazardous effects of air pollution not only affect the people stepping outdoors but also to the ones satying indoors.  While wearing a mask and avoiding areas with poor air quality is helpful, you should also include foods to combat air pollution in your diet. 

 It is crucial to have the correct diet to fight air pollution. Most important of all are antioxidants, which protect our body from harmful effects of air pollution. So, be sure to include the following nutrients in your daily meals. 

**1.** **Vitamin E:** Vitamin E, a fat-soluble vitamin, is the first line of defence against injury to human tissues. This vitamin usually comes in our diet from plant-based oils like sunflower, safflower and rice bran oil. Canola, peanut and olive oil are also rich sources of vitamin E. Almond, sunflower seeds and nuts also contain the vitamin but you should keep a check on their consumption due to their high-calorie content. Non-vegetarians can include salmon, roe and eel as a part of their diet to fight air pollution. Spices and herbs such as chilli powder, paprika, cloves, oregano, basil, and parsley also contain vitamin E.

**2.** **Vitamin C:** It the most potent antioxidant for our body. Vitamin C also contributes to Vitamin E regeneration. It is easily available in citrus fruits. Adults require 40mg/day of this vitamin. Vegetables like coriander, drumsticks, parsley, cabbage, and turnip greens are good sources of Vitamin C. Orange and guava are some fruits which are rich in this vitamin. It is advised to include the juice of 2 lemons in your daily diet to fight air pollution.

**3.** **Beta Carotene:** Beta carotene is a red/orange pigment found in many fresh fruits and vegetables. This nutrient plays an important role in controlling inflammation and converts to vitamin A in our body. Rich sources of beta carotene are leafy vegetables like amaranth, coriander, fenugreek, lettuce and spinach. Radish and carrots are also good sources.   

**4.** **Omega – 3 Fat:**  Including this in your diet, helps in protecting the body against the detrimental effects of air pollution your heart health and lipid profile. Fishes are rich sources of this fat. Vegetarians can try nuts, seeds like walnuts, chia seeds and flax seeds. Fenugreek seeds, Mustard seeds, green leafy vegetables are also good sources of Omega-3 fat.

**5.** **Ayurveda Solutions:** Apart from the above-mentioned vitamins and fats, Ayurveda also recommends some foods to combat air pollution. Certain spices and herbs that have antioxidant qualities are mentioned below. 

· Turmeric, a well-known antioxidant, is said to help protect the lungs from the toxic effects of pollutants.

· Turmeric and ghee (clarified butter) mixed relieve cough and aid during asthma. Turmeric with jaggery and butter can be taken during an asthmatic attack to relieve symptoms.

· Jaggery mixed with onion juice can be taken during both wet and dry cough. This concoction is said to have an expectorant effect.

·  According to Ayurveda, a diet rich in butter and astringent food should be taken, as opposed to sweet or sour foods, during asthma. Wheat and cow's milk are also believed to be beneficial for asthma patients. 

· People suffering from respiratory ailments should include ginger, black pepper, tulsi, liquorice, nutmeg, mint in their diet to fight air pollution.

I went through a period of smoking and partying after that and I was depressed as well so I lost all motivation to workout or eat. I still have a bit of the muscle from when I would work out but it’s mostly all gone now.

,diet,"TL;DR
I’m overweight, extremely picky, and in an environment where diet culture is triggering for the people around me. Need advice please 

I’m male, 20, 5’8 and 190lbs. So I’m very overweight, nearly obese. And I absolutely hate it. I used to be a little underweight/healthy, but since moving out two years ago and having to take care of myself it’s like a switch was flipped and suddenly I’ve gained 60+lbs in 20 months and don’t know what the fuck to do. I’m embarrassed of it and I don’t even want to leave the house anymore. 

I’ve tried so hard to lose weight but I’m finding it so so difficult to keep up with it. I exercise fairly regularly but it’s my diet that is really really fucking everything up. I have ARFID (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder) which basically means I’m picky as fuck and only eat about 3 things because anything else gives me massive anxiety and I refuse to try new things. My safe foods are junk foods. So I’m eating chicken strips and fries like 4 times a week and pasta the other days. On days where I try to eat better I just end up feeling so anxious and depressed that I resort back to my safe foods of stuff that’s not good for me. 

On top of this, my girlfriend (who I live with) has anorexia, and she is mostly recovered now but any talk of dieting or weight loss triggers her. I understand this and so try to be supportive in her recovery, by making sure she’s eating big portions and is enjoying her food. But this also is a big issue for me because it means I can’t really start a diet or anything without her also becoming obsessed with weight loss (this has happened before with us). 

I am really, really struggling and I don’t know what to do. I was hoping strangers who don’t know me can just offer me some help. I don’t care if you rip into me and call me fat, I know i am. Just some advice or tips or something. I don’t know.

,diet,"Why don’t adults play?

Physicist Steven Weinberg wrote, “The effort to understand the universe is one of the very few things that lifts human life above the level of farce, and gives it some of the grace of tragedy.” Quite pretty isn’t it? To think about it all (yes, every damn bit) and wonder how and question why. It is remarkable reflection. Humans find their dignity when they wonder and question. And it requires two things from you: 1) start with yourself and 2) use your fucking head.

On a warm night in a sticky month of a few years ago, my partner and I walked away from our long-term relationship. We will always love each other, but we were no longer in love with one another. Oh, and he found another little crumpet to give his time to. Which, in theory was fine…but not in application. I fell apart.

My eyes would unwelcomingly open at 5 am (an unnatural hour) every day and an immediate explosion would POP in my brain and I’d begin shaking. I’d cry. I was so afraid of the day. I was an anxious mess. I missed him. But what fancied me erratic was the reality that I was going to have to start dealing with my shit. I had been resigned to an “I am who I am” mentality which promotes little other than a low level of emotional intelligence. Oh, and it’s fucking lazy. It was time to deal with 25 years of suppressed and, after I was kickass at suppressing, repressed emotions. What fun. Part of the beauty of prior me (fuck yeah me!) was everything pretty much slipped off my shoulders. Didn’t cry. Didn’t rile. Had a decent time. But I know now that I wasn’t happy, which makes a happy and healthy relationship moderately unattainable.

One way to deal with immense anxiety is our dear friend alcohol. A wonderfully unproductive illusion-inducing drug. Nay, I’ve seen that story too often and she ugly. Comfort eating was out, I was too depressed. I masturbated a lot (a lot). Skipping ahead…I found exercise. But specifically, I mean I figured out exercise. And it saved my life. I am not sure I was going to do anything drastic, but I understood why some people choose to bonsoir prematurely. It is frightening to experience life lightless, but we all do and we all must.

I had to overcome my hellscape. I couldn’t sit at home and I’m not great with pity. So, I got moving. I didn’t give a shit about the number on a scale or how impressive the weight on the bar appeared. I didn’t obsess over counting micros or macros or limit my calorie count. I didn’t live at the gym or designate specific days for lifting or cardio. I paid attention to my mood, energy, and equanimity. I gave a fuck about killing the inner narrative that shook me. I gave a fuck about denying depression its dictation. I focused, I learned, I pushed myself, I rebuilt my self-confidence, I discovered the plurality of strength, and I found a more whole, happier, and healthier me. I learned to prefer to fuel my body instead of merely feed my body. And I went to the gym and I played.

This is an exploration of what I learned. I created this and 4 subsequent papers to be conversational and exploratory. So, why don’t adults play?

Why, as adults, do we become the Augustus Gloop we always wanted to be? Is that what we wanted? What happens between adolescence and fending-for-ourselves that we decide our movement is bed to desk chair to couch to bed? Why is fast “food” - eat french fries like a smoker smokes and see what the hell happens to your health - an acceptable staple? In our youth we had at least one caretaker to jam undesired and poorly prepared nutritional foods (see: squash…no amount of reconditioning is making that mush palatable) down our throats and toss us outside. Now we’re in control and we eat, drink, and do as we please. We’re adults damnit! Are we actually in control?

If our body were a car, good nutrition would be the equivalent high octane fuel and a good night’s rest would be that of a pit stop. I’m sure all you car fanatics could relate to that. Take away good fuel and you end up with a messed up engine in a few years. Take away pit stops and you’re eventually going to see smoke rising out of your car bonnet. Bottom line is, it’s essential.

I don’t mean to play the devil, but I’m afraid I have to break it to you. Spending two hours at the gym is no excuse for binging on a pack of cookies for dinner. ‘But it’s okay to eat junk if you do an hour of cardio, right?’ No! Who ever said that? Let me get this straight. Training does have its place, but without the right nutrition and rest, you are not getting anywhere. Now, I am not telling you to eat like a patient for the rest of your life. What I’m going to throw light upon via this eBook is the importance of adequate rest and proper nutrition as a part of your fitness lifestyle.

,diet,"Ok so I have done all the fad diets, starved myself, ran till I puked, etc. Of course they all worked, but none were sustainable.
“Counting calories? Who wants to live like that?” I’d always say.
Turns out, I DO.
After HATING keto, like hating it (please don’t burn me at the stake you religious keto obsessed mob...) I downloaded MyFitnessPal.
I put in my goals and was pretty upset to be told... 1200 calorie diet.
“Whatever, I’ll leave the goal as is and just track everything and do my best.”
I have learned a ridiculous amount about nutrition in the last three weeks, along with losing 3 pounds, no exercise except dog walks. Just three weeks of trying my best, watching the food go in my mouth, and observing what the reports had to say about my choices.
Here were the huge takeaways, and why I am *so grateful* I finally pulled my head out of my ass and faced the facts.

1. Low carb means low calories. Carbs are dense. If you take them out, your calories go down. If you plan your day a little, which quickly becomes an autopilot thing, you can eat bread and potatoes etc. I’m not talking about keto, I’m talking low carb.

2. Protein is hard to get, and I wasn’t eating even half of what I needed.

3. Eating enough protein changes everything! You don’t feel hungry. Mentally, I feel better. I wish I’d known this would improve my energy levels so much.

4. Getting enough iron from food is ridiculously difficult. I am eating a can of oysters and a Hefty portion of liver pate a day - on my very low calorie diet, I just don’t have enough space to meet the very very high recommended intake for women if I don’t. If anyone has any suggestions, please tell me. Especially heme iron.

5. I would have NEVER been able to accomplish this without MyFitnessPal, which is FREE!

,diet,"Hi,

So earlier this year I started working with a meal prep company to get pre-made, pre-cooked meals that I can warm up. This has really worked great for me so far, in terms of cutting back on eating out/eating fast food, and I feel better &amp; have lost some weight. But now I want to evaluate the meal plan.

The typical meal consists of the following:

6 oz of meat (grilled chicken, steak, ground turkey, grilled tilapia)

6 oz of carb (diced potatoes - either red or sweet)

6 oz of vegetables (broccoli, green beans, diced up peppers)

I'll generally have two of these meals a day, and then either skip a third meal, or have something light for breakfast like some yogurt/fruit, or occasionally a bagel. My main goal right now is to lose weight, and a secondary goal is to build muscle.

,diet,"So I just got back from shopping and I had spent almost 300$ on almost every single ingredient suggested to me on [here](https://i.imgur.com/N05f8tN.png) which was a site that I used to generate my meal plan for one of those days. I don't think it'd be as bad as I did if the serving sizes weren't so bad.

Well, if I was to use 8 ounces per meal and had that same meal 2 days in a row, I would only be able to get 2 days out of that $17 steak.

,diet,"Tl;dr at the bottom— post is a bit of a word salad and I’m sorry

Hey guys, 

I’ll just cut right to the chase. About a year ago I began suffering a pretty intense mental break, and have since been diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar type disorder and sort of gave up on life. I gained 60 pounds and was a paranoid, delusional mess up until quarantine kind of began. 

I had a pretty great talk with my uncle and he told me that even suffering is a valuable experience and since then I’ve began working out substantially and even joined a boxing gym. My resting heart rate has gone from 76 bpm to 64 and I’m losing weight like crazy. 

My only issue is this: I’m burning so many calories a day that psychotic symptoms start to manifest again presumably because of the deficit— the brain works in a very top-down sort of way. 

So my question is, since I’m burning around 4000 calories a day, and plan on pursuing boxing as a form of discipline and self mastery. That being said, what should I be eating? What macros and micros should I focus on? It’s a ton of cardio, and I really don’t know much about anything. I’m sorry if this is all over the place, and if this isn’t the right place to post this but any help literally transfers into mental well being. I will try anything. Thank you all so much.

,diet,"Recently, I was surprised to find I have been diagnosed with Gilbert syndrome from a blood test, although it did explain my persistently yellow eyes for years without any other health complications. However, looking into it further, it started to make me worry, since I eat about 200 grams of dry oats with milk a day and they have a very high amount of manganese. If I understand it correctly, Gilbert syndrome is a liver defect implying that there would be a higher absorption of manganese, which makes me worry, since I am already near, but under, the recommended long-term amount of manganese a day. A too high consumption of manganese can lead to manganism which is a serious condition.

However, looking into it further, it started to make me worry, since I eat about 200 grams of dry oats with milk a day and they have a very high amount of manganese.

,diet,"I’m Over 6 weeks postpartum. I was extremely overweight during my pregnancy. I was 200lbs the day I gave birth. My son was 10.5 lbs, and I lost a lot of blood after. I was about 163lbs (5ft 3inches tall) before I get pregnant and right now I’m close to being back to my pre pregnancy weight - 166 lbs.
I am however still hoping to lose 30lbs more to be at least on my healthy BMI weight.
I’m very picky when it comes to food, I don’t eat all kinds of veggies and fruits. I try to eat more fruits but not much on berries. I’m Asian so rice is part of our staple meal, although I only eat rice about 1-2 x /week.
I don’t exercise a lot but I do carry my son on a baby carrier or his stroller and take a walk about 1-2x/week for at least 30 mins to an hour.
Is there anything else that I could do to help my weight go down more?
I exclusively breastfeed at least 7x on a 24 hr period lasting 20-45 mins per feeding, if that helps.
