To be clear on a couple terms -- when exercising and eating to gain weight, that is called **bulking** (aka caloric ""surplus""). Eating less to lose weight is called **cutting** (aka caloric ""deficit""). And eating just enough to not gain or lose weight is called **maintenance** (aka recomposition or ""recomp"").

#A visual guide to male and female BF% estimates

* [From athleanx](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8IPmtkFYQx/?igshid=17upb60h7gk3)

I don’t like guessing BF% as there’s no way to know how much visceral fat we store internally. But athleanx’s general guidelines are as good as any for visual estimates.

#Who should cut or bulk?

The idea behind cut and bulk cycles is to gain muscle and fat in a bulk phase and then try to keep all your muscle and burn off fat in a cut phase. This approach is generally 'faster', when done correctly, than ""recomps"" (recompositions) where you maintain your weight but work out hard and try to replace fat with muscle.

Generally speaking, if you're an active person and/or consistently working out, you can do cut/bulk cycles. To get started, you need to know your **maintenance** calories (""maint"") to have an idea on how many calories you can consume without gaining or losing weight, hence the term maintenance; no change in weight. To bulk, you eat more than maintenance (aka ""surplus"") and to cut you eat less than maintenance (aka ""deficit""). If you *are not* working out and you bulk, that's how you get fat. So don't eat above maint if you're not also working out. 

#Getting started

To get started, you need to know your ""maintenance"" calorie needs and for an estimate you need a TDEE calculator (I like [this one](https://tdeecalculator.net/), but you can google for others). Think of this as a starting point to use that will need some adjusting over time.

Once you have an estimated maintenance, you generally add 250-500 calories for a bulk and subtract 250-750 calories in a cut. Generally, it's safer to over-do cuts and under-do bulks. In a bulk you gain both fat and muscle and after a point you only gain fat (fat stores faster than you can build new muscle), so be cautious in bulks and don't ""dirty"" bulk. 

#Deciding to cut or bulk

So far as I'm aware, there isn't a hard science behind *when* to bulk or cut, but there are guidelines to consider. When bulking, our bodies build muscle *and* store fat and, after a point, our bodies prioritize storing fat over building muscle. This is why dirty bulking is bad and, generally speaking, if your BF% is &gt; 20%, you should not bulk. Any higher BF% and your body tends to prioritize fat storage vs muscle gained from bulking.

Similarly, cuts are usually done to around 10% because any lower than that and the body will begin to consume more muscle than fat and muscle loss is more likely.

You *can* make strength gains on a cut. You can't build new muscle, but you can ""refactor"" (that's my word for it, I'm sure there's a scientific one) existing muscle to be more efficient, hence stronger, as you lose fat. Also, repetitive gym visits will help you become more proficient at working out which helps in the long run when you start bulking and building new muscle.

If you're really unsure, you can make a post in /r/BulkOrCut to get community feedback on what it's you personally should do.

If you're skinnyfat, generally you can eat at a small maintenance (aka ""clean bulk"") and make great strength gains. If you have little muscle mass to cut to, you will just look tiny/thin -- especially if you're tall. So for most skinnyfat people, and I would clean bulk and diligently follow a legit lifting routine. Which brings me to...

#Workout routines

Before getting into routines, I think it's worth mentioning first that **everyone should walk more**. At least 5 times per week, 30 minutes per day:

* [Get ripped. Get walking.](https://www.t-nation.com/training/get-ripped-get-walking)

Check out [The Beginner's Guide to Working Out](https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/ihz264/beginners_guide_to_working_out/).

The best workout routine is the one you can consistently follow. If you're new to the gym, just about anything will get you some results. To a point. If you want to be smart about it, **do not make up your own routine!** There are plenty of legit, tried-and-true, FREE [recommended lifting routines](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/) to choose from. I like these routines vs googling something random because these are routines many, many people in various subreddits are doing and have done in the past that can help answer any questions you might have. It's nice to have someone else that is doing or has done the program you're running to offer direct advice from their experience. But you can just google other routines if you want. Just make sure it has:

* 1) Progressive overload

* 2) Structured days to not hit body parts more than 2x/week

If you're working out at home, check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/GovSchwarzenegger/comments/flz3es/stay_at_home_stay_fit/) from Arnold Schwarzenegger with a detailed bodyweight home routine.

#What to eat

At the end of the day, for 99% of people (various diseases, ailments, and conditions aside), all that matters are Calories In, Calories Out (CICO). This controls weight **gain** and **loss**. Lifting heavy weights encourages **strength gains** or at least strength maintenance in both surplus/bulks and deficit/cuts. But to gain or lose lbs on a scale, the total calories consumed minus calories used and the resulting surplus/deficit are what matters. But how much of what you eat matters...

There's a lot of suggested science over what to eat, but there are generally sound rules of thumbs to follow which are easily broken down into ""Macros"" for tracking purposes:

* Proteins (1 gram = 4 calories)

* Carbs (1 gram = 4 calories)

* Fats (1 gram = 9 calories)

Collectively, all the macros we consume = total consumption (Calories In). When cutting, it's easiest to cut down fats and carbs. But keep protein high. When bulking, generally you add carbs and/or fats. Protein should always be high; it's what helps build muscle directly.

However, *how we feel* when consuming these calories and what we get out of other nutrients is important.

##Fats

We all need healthy fats to help regulate hormonal balances. This is usually room-temp fats (think extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, various nuts, avocados, etc); less important are the fats in meat and dairy products, for example. A general rule of thumb is to aim for at least **30% x total calories** for your fats macro. This is the same for cutting or bulking, but when bulking you can increase if you want.

E.g. if you're consuming 2000 calories daily, aim for 0.3x2000 (600) calories to be from fats.

##Carbs

Next come carbs. Carbs are not evil. They're a tool. Our body prefers and relies on carbs to refuel energy stores. Simple, nutrient-dense carbs are preferred -- not complex or junk carbs. The reason for this is 1) satiation, how long we'll feel full, and 2) other nutrient content. When you can, get your carbs from fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. That will do far more for you than crackers, cereal, donuts, etc. Even though the carbs will be utilized equally, produce holds far more vitamins and minerals that have relevant health and recovery benefits that can't be overstated.

Generally, aim for **25-45%** of your calories to be carbs (depending on cutting/bulking).

##Protein

Generally, you want to keep protein fairly high. Anywhere from **.75-1+ gram of protein per lbs of body weight.** This can come from any source, as our body will utilize them the same. But some sources are preferred, depending on whether you're cutting or bulking. Ideally, aim for now more than 40-50 grams per meal/protein shake and spread out the consumption through the day.

The remainder of your calories should be protein.

##Timing

As carbs are for energy, many people prefer to have more carbs timed around workouts (and no fats during this period) to help boost performance and recovery. If you're going to eat your carbs (e.g. rice and chicken breast), do so about two hours before working out; otherwise, liquid/quickly consumed carbs are preferred (e.g. orange or apple juice). Again, post-workout, get simple carbs and protein into your system via a shake or meal fairly soon. Save fats for well-before or after workouts.

#Measuring success

First and foremost, gym progress should always be factored in first. If your routine says X lift should go up Y amount each week, generally you want to be hitting that to know you're on track. If your lift #s are going up according to your routine, you're doing great! If you aren't, there's a breakdown somewhere and you should ask for guidance if you cannot asses the fail point yourself.

Secondly, the weight scale. You want to make sure your body weight is trending in your goal direction. It's ideal to weigh yourself *the same way* every time. 

For example, I wake up, go to the bathroom, and then weigh myself every day for three weeks and then I average my daily changes over those three weeks. I generally aim to gain .5-.75 lbs per week and lose .75-1 lbs per week. If I'm gaining or losing too much, I adjust my macros ~ 250 calories and measure again for three weeks and so on.

Don't get caught up daily changes; I sometimes vary 3-5 lbs between days! Weigh daily for three weeks and average it out. Don't worry about the daily weight, find an average to determine where the trend is taking you and adjust if needed. This will take the annoying variances out of the picture and let you focus on meaningful change.

You can also measure your wrists, waist, neck, etc, as well as take photos, but that's more preference and not as commonly suggested.

#Bulking and cutting strategies

I've seen people make amazing progress, both gaining and losing weight, in a variety of ways. Ideally, be healthy. Emphasize fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. But, at the end of the day, **many approaches work**. You can bulk or cut as a vegan, intermittent fasting (""IF""), KETO, IIFYM, etc. Many approaches work. They are but tools available to you, so find one that best helps you meet your goal. So choose the best ""diet"" or tool that helps you achieve a goal! If that's keto, great! If that's caveman, awesome. I don't care! Limit your calories in whatever ""diet"" you choose and you'll see results.

In my opinion, it's better to make *lifestyle* changes that to follow a diet for a short time. So I don't really like ""diets"" per se, but more so recommend eating like an adult and limiting calories. But even still, different tactics can help in that goal, and you can deploy as many or as few as you want:

* Intermittent Fasting (""IF"")

* Tracking macros / IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros)

* ""Banking"" calories

I don't buy into the other 'benefits' of **IF**, but it was a tactic that worked for me. I am a volume eater. I generally eat well, but I like eating *a lot*. So when I'm cutting, my meals were small and sad. The idea behind IF is that you have a short window of time which you eat meals, the rest of the day you fast. Again, all that matters are calories. You can absolutely get fat eating 10k calories in a 5 hour window. So there's no magic in doing this. But for me, doing IF allowed me to have larger, more satiating meals within the ""eating window"" instead of more, smaller meals.

**Macros** are discussed above, but the idea behind IIFYM is that you've a set # for each macro and, so long as what you're eating fits neatly into the prescribed macro allotment, go for eating whatever you want! And, again, so long as total calories are low enough for you, you will lose weight. But this is /r/BulkorCut, not /r/weightloss. People here are also working out. **How well you workout, recover, perform, feel, etc** is affected by what you eat. So, sure, add in ""fun"" foods sometimes. But don't eat like a child simply because it fit your macros. A safe rule of thumb is to eat ""cleanly"" 80% of the time when bulking, whatever the other 20% of the time. When cutting, I try to eat cleanly 90-95% of the time with fewer treats. What that treat is might change -- some weeks I just want pancakes, other weeks I just want a couple beers. Do what works for you, just do so in controlled quantities.

I liked **""banking"" calories** when I knew I had a special event, date night with the wife, party, or whatever where I'd be consuming extra calories. One way to account for that is to deduct an *additional* amount of calories each day leading up to the event, to then splurge on that event. Example:

Let's say my maintenance is 2,500 calories and I'm eating at a -500 deficit, so I'm eating 2,000 calories daily. I want to take my wife out for our anniversary, so the week leading up to our date night I deduct an additional -250 calories each day and only eat 1,750 calories daily. This gives me 7x250 (=1750) ""banked"" calories I can add to my 2,000 calories on our anniversary. Now I can have a nice dinner, dessert, a drink or two, all without blowing my diet out of whack!

#Body fat % (BF%) estimates

Estimating ones body fat % is kind of hard. We can't see how much fat is stored internally around organs; some people store more fat over the abs, some more around their love handles (that's me!), and others in their legs/ass. So it's really hard to tell. There are various ways to scan BF%, but most are imprecise with a +/- 20% variance. In my opinion, the only thing they're useful for is estimating BF% *changes*. Let's say it reads 20% for you; in six months, you try again and it says 15%. You probably lost around 5% BF%, but your actual BF% might be 12%-18%. So it's not a particularly accurate reading, but the rate change is a useful gauge.

The best ways to learn BF% are via:

* Underwater Weighing (Hydrostatic Weighing) (1-2% variance)

* DEXA scan (1-2% variance)

Everything else has huge variance and is only useful for measuring rate of change.

To bulk, you eat more than maintenance (aka &amp;quot;surplus&amp;quot;) and to cut you eat less than maintenance (aka &amp;quot;deficit&amp;quot;). If you &lt;em&gt;are not&lt;/em&gt; working out and you bulk, that&amp;#39;s how you get fat. So don&amp;#39;t eat above maint if you&amp;#39;re not also working out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Getting started&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, you need to know your &amp;quot;maintenance&amp;quot; calorie needs and for an estimate you need a TDEE calculator (I like &lt;a href=""https://tdeecalculator.net/""&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, but you can google for others).

This is why dirty bulking is bad and, generally speaking, if your BF% is &amp;gt; 20%, you should not bulk. Any higher BF% and your body tends to prioritize fat storage vs muscle gained from bulking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, cuts are usually done to around 10% because any lower than that and the body will begin to consume more muscle than fat and muscle loss is more likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make strength gains on a cut. You can&amp;#39;t build new muscle, but you can &amp;quot;refactor&amp;quot; (that&amp;#39;s my word for it, I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a scientific one) existing muscle to be more efficient, hence stronger, as you lose fat.

&lt;h2&gt;Protein&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, you want to keep protein fairly high. Anywhere from &lt;strong&gt;.75-1+ gram of protein per lbs of body weight.&lt;/strong&gt; This can come from any source, as our body will utilize them the same. But some sources are preferred, depending on whether you&amp;#39;re cutting or bulking. Ideally, aim for now more than 40-50 grams per meal/protein shake and spread out the consumption through the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of your calories should be protein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Timing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As carbs are for energy, many people prefer to have more carbs timed around workouts (and no fats during this period) to help boost performance and recovery. If you&amp;#39;re going to eat your carbs (e.g. rice and chicken breast), do so about two hours before working out; otherwise, liquid/quickly consumed carbs are preferred (e.g. orange or apple juice). Again, post-workout, get simple carbs and protein into your system via a shake or meal fairly soon. Save fats for well-before or after workouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Measuring success&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, gym progress should always be factored in first. If your routine says X lift should go up Y amount each week, generally you want to be hitting that to know you&amp;#39;re on track. If your lift #s are going up according to your routine, you&amp;#39;re doing great! If you aren&amp;#39;t, there&amp;#39;s a breakdown somewhere and you should ask for guidance if you cannot asses the fail point yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the weight scale. You want to make sure your body weight is trending in your goal direction. It&amp;#39;s ideal to weigh yourself &lt;em&gt;the same way&lt;/em&gt; every time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I wake up, go to the bathroom, and then weigh myself every day for three weeks and then I average my daily changes over those three weeks. I generally aim to gain .5-.75 lbs per week and lose .75-1 lbs per week. If I&amp;#39;m gaining or losing too much, I adjust my macros ~ 250 calories and measure again for three weeks and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get caught up daily changes; I sometimes vary 3-5 lbs between days! Weigh daily for three weeks and average it out. Don&amp;#39;t worry about the daily weight, find an average to determine where the trend is taking you and adjust if needed. This will take the annoying variances out of the picture and let you focus on meaningful change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also measure your wrists, waist, neck, etc, as well as take photos, but that&amp;#39;s more preference and not as commonly suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bulking and cutting strategies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen people make amazing progress, both gaining and losing weight, in a variety of ways. Ideally, be healthy. Emphasize fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. But, at the end of the day, &lt;strong&gt;many approaches work&lt;/strong&gt;. You can bulk or cut as a vegan, intermittent fasting (&amp;quot;IF&amp;quot;), KETO, IIFYM, etc. Many approaches work. They are but tools available to you, so find one that best helps you meet your goal. So choose the best &amp;quot;diet&amp;quot; or tool that helps you achieve a goal! If that&amp;#39;s keto, great! If that&amp;#39;s caveman, awesome. I don&amp;#39;t care! Limit your calories in whatever &amp;quot;diet&amp;quot; you choose and you&amp;#39;ll see results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it&amp;#39;s better to make &lt;em&gt;lifestyle&lt;/em&gt; changes that to follow a diet for a short time. So I don&amp;#39;t really like &amp;quot;diets&amp;quot; per se, but more so recommend eating like an adult and limiting calories. But even still, different tactics can help in that goal, and you can deploy as many or as few as you want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermittent Fasting (&amp;quot;IF&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking macros / IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Banking&amp;quot; calories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t buy into the other &amp;#39;benefits&amp;#39; of &lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt;, but it was a tactic that worked for me. I am a volume eater. I generally eat well, but I like eating &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. So when I&amp;#39;m cutting, my meals were small and sad. The idea behind IF is that you have a short window of time which you eat meals, the rest of the day you fast. Again, all that matters are calories. You can absolutely get fat eating 10k calories in a 5 hour window. So there&amp;#39;s no magic in doing this. But for me, doing IF allowed me to have larger, more satiating meals within the &amp;quot;eating window&amp;quot; instead of more, smaller meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macros&lt;/strong&gt; are discussed above, but the idea behind IIFYM is that you&amp;#39;ve a set # for each macro and, so long as what you&amp;#39;re eating fits neatly into the prescribed macro allotment, go for eating whatever you want! And, again, so long as total calories are low enough for you, you will lose weight. But this is &lt;a href=""/r/BulkorCut""&gt;/r/BulkorCut&lt;/a&gt;, not &lt;a href=""/r/weightloss""&gt;/r/weightloss&lt;/a&gt;. People here are also working out. &lt;strong&gt;How well you workout, recover, perform, feel, etc&lt;/strong&gt; is affected by what you eat. So, sure, add in &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; foods sometimes. But don&amp;#39;t eat like a child simply because it fit your macros. A safe rule of thumb is to eat &amp;quot;cleanly&amp;quot; 80% of the time when bulking, whatever the other 20% of the time. When cutting, I try to eat cleanly 90-95% of the time with fewer treats. What that treat is might change -- some weeks I just want pancakes, other weeks I just want a couple beers. Do what works for you, just do so in controlled quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;banking&amp;quot; calories&lt;/strong&gt; when I knew I had a special event, date night with the wife, party, or whatever where I&amp;#39;d be consuming extra calories. One way to account for that is to deduct an &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; amount of calories each day leading up to the event, to then splurge on that event. Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say my maintenance is 2,500 calories and I&amp;#39;m eating at a -500 deficit, so I&amp;#39;m eating 2,000 calories daily. I want to take my wife out for our anniversary, so the week leading up to our date night I deduct an additional -250 calories each day and only eat 1,750 calories daily. This gives me 7x250 (=1750) &amp;quot;banked&amp;quot; calories I can add to my 2,000 calories on our anniversary. Now I can have a nice dinner, dessert, a drink or two, all without blowing my diet out of whack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Body fat % (BF%) estimates&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimating ones body fat % is kind of hard. We can&amp;#39;t see how much fat is stored internally around organs; some people store more fat over the abs, some more around their love handles (that&amp;#39;s me!), and others in their legs/ass. So it&amp;#39;s really hard to tell. There are various ways to scan BF%, but most are imprecise with a +/- 20% variance. In my opinion, the only thing they&amp;#39;re useful for is estimating BF% &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt;. Let&amp;#39;s say it reads 20% for you; in six months, you try again and it says 15%. You probably lost around 5% BF%, but your actual BF% might be 12%-18%. So it&amp;#39;s not a particularly accurate reading, but the rate change is a useful gauge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best ways to learn BF% are via:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underwater Weighing (Hydrostatic Weighing) (1-2% variance)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEXA scan (1-2% variance)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything else has huge variance and is only useful for measuring rate of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Differences in males and females&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It ultimately comes down to &lt;strong&gt;goals&lt;/strong&gt; and therefore what you&amp;#39;re going to emphasize/work towards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,workout," As a personal trainer, I wanted to take the time to answer some of the most frequently asked questions by people who are new to working out. Feel free to let me know if I've missed anything!

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I lose weight?

It’s actually way simpler than you might think: maintain a caloric deficit. Consume fewer calories than you burn. It doesn’t matter of you’re morbidly obese or you’re cutting for a show, this basic principal still applies. Note that eating a healthy diet makes this **far** easier - lots of fruits, veggies, lean protein and water will help you stay satiated for far fewer calories than fatty junk foods (not to mention you’ll have way more energy, and just feel better).

To find out how many calories you should be eating in a day to lose weight, you have a few different options. The first is to determine your maintenance calories with an online calculator, then subtract 250-500 per day from that (to lose about 0.5-1lbs per week). 

The other option (my personal favourite, because everyone is different!) is to start by just honestly tallying up how much you’re currently eating each day. Once that’s determined, start by subtracting 250-500 calories per day. If you haven’t lost any weight in a couple weeks, subtract that amount again, until you start seeing progress.

There’s tons of food tracking apps out there, but I recommend [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) \- it’s free, easy to use, you can scan food labels, and the food database included is enormous.

Another important note - increasing the amount of calories you burn per day (ie. exercising) will also help you stay in a caloric deficit. However, it’s best NOT to rely solely on this method. Doing a whole hour of cardio will only burn a few hundred calories (plus will likely make you hungry for snacks by the time you’re finished) … or, you can simply avoid eating a bag of chips or a piece of pizza, to have the exact same effect. 

That’s not to imply that exercise isn’t important in your weight loss journey - quite the contrary! However, instead of focusing on doing hours of cardio a day, this should only be used to supplement your diet (1-2 hours a week is fine for most people). Your focus should instead be on resistance training. Lifting heavy weights 2-4 times per week plays the important role of ensuring you **maintain your muscle mass as you lose weight.** Want to avoid that “skinny fat” look, and get “toned” instead? Make sure you’re doing resistance training! 

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I lose weight in ___ area?

Unfortunately, spot reduction is a myth. Where you lose weight first (and last) is determined by genetics. However, you \*will\* eventually lose weight in all your problem areas. You just need to be patient, and keep doing what helped you start losing weight in the first place.

 The good news is, the more weight you lose, the more visible the progress will be (especially if you’re doing a good job focusing on just fat loss, while retaining muscle). Going from 250-240lbs probably won’t be noticeable, but losing those last 10lbs will make a huge difference (since a few pounds will make up a far greater percentage of your total body mass). So the progress will be hard-fought for, but definitely worth it! 

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I gain muscle?

It’s a combination of progressively harder resistance training, eating enough food, and lots of patience.

When you’re exercising, just going through the motions isn’t good enough. For optimal muscle gain, you should be performing each set with a weight that you can lift continuously for around 30-60s (this should amount to around 8-15 repetitions). If you feel like you can go for longer, choose a heavier weight. 

Perform each repetition slowly (about 1 second concentric, pause, 2-3 seconds eccentric, pause), through a full range of motion. To clarify - the concentric portion of a lift is when you’re moving against gravity, and the eccentric portion is when you’re moving with gravity. Exercises involving long static holds (like planks) are great for endurance, but they won’t amount to much muscle mass gained.

I cannot overemphasize how important good form is either - for avoiding injury, hardwiring the correct neural pathways, and maximizing muscle gain. Especially when you’re just starting out, choose light weights, and make sure optimal form comes naturally before you start increasing the intensity. It’s way easier learning it correctly the first time than fixing bad habits later.

How much food should you be eating? It varies widely between people. Start with your maintenance calories, add a couple hundred to that (it doesn’t have to be a lot!), and measure your results. Be patient with your progress - men can expect to gain 1-2lbs of lean muscle a month, and 0.5-1lbs for women (beginners may gain a little faster). Eating enough protein is also vital to gaining muscle - a general rule of thumb is around 1 gram of protein (each day) per pound of lean body weight (ie. how much you weigh, minus the amount of fat you have). 

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I get stronger?

It honestly depends on your experience level. If you’re just starting out, doing a normal resistance routine focused on gaining muscle will make you stronger. However, if you’ve been working out regularly for awhile (close to a year), using heavier weights (1-6 reps max) will help you get stronger a lot faster. 

If you’re focusing more purely on strength gain, it’s important that each repetition is done as perfectly as possible (even moreso than for other training goals). That means stopping 1-2 reps shy of failure. Doing just one sloppy rep can severely impact your strength output for the rest of the workout. Don’t be afraid of taking longer rests between sets either (up to 2-3 minutes), as you want to be ready with as much energy as possible before you start your next set. It also goes without saying that heavier weight = greater chance for injury, and proper form will help prevent that.

&amp;#x200B;

### Is it possible to lose fat and build muscle at the same time?

Contrary to popular belief - yes. Especially if you’re a beginner! Just make sure you’re eating around maintenance level calories (along with enough protein), doing resistance training 3-4 times a week, and you’ll start seeing body composition changes. 

However, if you’re significantly over/underweight, or have already been working out for some time, you’ll see much faster progress if you focus on one goal at a time. The main difference here is going to be diet - eating less if you’re trying to lose weight, or eating more if you’re trying to gain weight. Regular resistance training plays a part in both shedding fat and gaining muscle.

&amp;#x200B;

### How should I be structuring my workouts?

For the vast majority of people, full body workouts with compound exercises is the way to go. (For those who don’t know, compound exercises are those which use more than one joint at a time - think squats, bench press, rows, etc.)

The popular back/chest/shoulders/arms/legs split routine (or any variation of it) is good for advanced bodybuilders, but not ideal for beginners. Bodybuilders exercise like this because they need a much greater stimulus to properly stress any given muscle group, and more rest between days training that muscle group as a result of their increased workout intensity.

For a beginner, it’s better to hit each muscle group multiple times a week (this is great to hasten learning and growth). You won’t need as long of a rest period before training the same muscle again, because it won’t be as fatigued after each workout.

Compound exercises give you the greatest bang for your buck because you’re working out so many muscles in one movement (and burning way more calories at the same time). Isolation exercises (those working one joint at a time, like bicep curls or leg extensions) are best for bodybuilders who really need to hone in on a single muscle.

Doing resistance training 3-4 times a week is a good goal to shoot for. Workouts should be around 45-60 minutes, with around 6-8 exercises done during that time. Try to keep rests between sets to around 60s (this is all very generalized, and can change depending on experience level and goal). Space rest days evenly between workouts if you can.

Start your workouts with the exercises which require the most energy (usually those which involve lifting the most weight), saving any isolation/ab exercises for the end.

If you’d like some help planning your workout routine, I just released a fitness app called [PerfectFit](https://www.perfect-fit.app/). It gives you access to workouts designed by a personal trainer, all customized according to your unique goals, fitness level, and available equipment. There are tons of bodyweight exercises included - ideal for anyone working out at home! The app is currently available to download on Android, and iOS is hopefully just a few days away (currently under review).

&amp;#x200B;

### What should I be eating?

If your goal is a change in body composition (gaining muscle/losing fat), the amount of calories you’re consuming is the most important thing to pay attention to.

If you’re consistently working out hard but failing to gain/lose weight, chances are you need to make alterations to your diet. For weight loss, that usually means eating at a deficit of 250-500 calories per day; for weight gain, eating at a surplus of 200-300 calories per day.

What exact foods you’re eating has an impact on how easily you can stick to your calorie goals, as well as your energy levels.

Consuming around 1 gram of protein per pound of lean bodyweight (per day) is a given, regardless of what your fitness goal is. This helps to maintain satiety, and preserve/increase muscle mass.

Eating lots of fruits and veggies (as well as drinking 2-3L of water a day - more for some people) is a great way to feel full without consuming too many calories. It also just contributes to all-around health and energy levels.

Eating lots of fatty foods should be avoided if weight loss is the goal - not because fat makes you fat per se, but because they are so calorically dense. Only one tablespoon of peanut butter or olive oil is 100 calories! Conversely, if your goal is to **gain** weight, adding more fatty foods to your diet (healthy fats, if possible) can help you hit that calorie goal easier.

And carbs? Not as evil as people make them out to be. Think of them as the energy that fuels your brain and your workouts. Having around 50% of your calories coming from carbs is about the norm. It’s likely beneficial to raise this number even higher if you’re an especially lean individual, or you’re regularly working out at intense levels.

&amp;#x200B;

### When should I be eating?

The easiest way to time your meals properly is to think: “What will I be doing in the next 2-3 hours?” Eat according to the activity you’re about to do. That doesn’t mean you should be having a giant meal right before your workout, but ideally your biggest meal of the day would be several hours before you exercise. This will give you the energy you need, plus ensure the calories you consume are shuttled into your muscles instead of fat reserves.

If you’re about to do an intense workout, the best thing to eat beforehand (around 15-30 minutes prior) is a light snack of healthy carbs (like some fruit). For optimal recovery, aim for 20-30g of protein within an hour after you workout (if you miss this window though don’t worry about it). A protein shake is probably the simplest and most convenient way of doing this, but whole food is just as good.

&amp;#x200B;

### What supplements should I be taking?

If you have a healthy, well-rounded diet, including 2-3 cups of different veggies each day,  enough protein per pound of bodyweight (from sources that include sufficient amounts of each essential amino acid), and adequate omega-3 fatty acids - then you’re golden, and probably don’t need any supplements.

However, the vast majority of the population would probably benefit from a simple multivitamin and omega-3 supplement, just to help fill any nutritional gaps they have.

If you’re getting enough protein from whole food, then you probably don’t need to add protein powder. However, if you’re struggling with this, then protein powder is a great way to easily increase your daily protein intake. Whey protein is the most bioavailable and has a complete amino acid profile, so it’s the best choice for most people. However, if you’re vegan (or lactose intolerant), there are lots of plant proteins available. You just need to pay attention to the amino acid profile of each one (possibly mixing and matching different plant sources if you need to).

As for all the other supplements out there, it’s honestly on a case-by-case basis as to whether they’d actually help you or not. If you’re a beginner, unless you have any specific requirements or deficits, you probably don’t need them.

&amp;#x200B;

### Is stretching important?

Yes. Please stretch (or do some other form of myofascial release, such as foam rolling), or you’ll eventually regret it. Regular exercise makes your muscles slowly form clumps of tissue and fascia. Neglecting to release these can result in restricted range of motion, and eventually pain.

Static stretching should be done at the **end** of your workout. Aim to stretch each worked muscle near its end range of motion for around 60s total. Don’t stretch before your workout, as this can impede strength output.

&amp;#x200B;

### Is warming up important?

Yes. Warming up is paramount to increasing blood flow and activating your muscles properly before you move onto more intense, metabolically demanding exercises. 

Ideally, during your warm-up, you should be actively moving your muscles through the same ranges of motion you’ll be doing for your workout. This can be as simple as doing the exact same movement, but with minimal weight - for example, doing a few sets of bodyweight squats before doing barbell squats.

You want your warm-ups to elevate your heart rate, but not be so intense that they start tiring you out and detract from your workout. Usually 5-10 minutes of light activity is enough.",t2_7tzbnpvc,False,,0,False,Beginner's Guide to Working Out,[],r/workout,False,6,standard,0,,False,t3_ihz264,False,dark,0.99,,public,157,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Routine Help,False,157,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598611352.0,text,6,,,text,self.workout,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a personal trainer, I wanted to take the time to answer some of the most frequently asked questions by people who are new to working out.

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, spot reduction is a myth. Where you lose weight first (and last) is determined by genetics. However, you *will* eventually lose weight in all your problem areas. You just need to be patient, and keep doing what helped you start losing weight in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is, the more weight you lose, the more visible the progress will be (especially if you’re doing a good job focusing on just fat loss, while retaining muscle). Going from 250-240lbs probably won’t be noticeable, but losing those last 10lbs will make a huge difference (since a few pounds will make up a far greater percentage of your total body mass). So the progress will be hard-fought for, but definitely worth it! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How do I gain muscle?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a combination of progressively harder resistance training, eating enough food, and lots of patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re exercising, just going through the motions isn’t good enough. For optimal muscle gain, you should be performing each set with a weight that you can lift continuously for around 30-60s (this should amount to around 8-15 repetitions). If you feel like you can go for longer, choose a heavier weight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perform each repetition slowly (about 1 second concentric, pause, 2-3 seconds eccentric, pause), through a full range of motion. To clarify - the concentric portion of a lift is when you’re moving against gravity, and the eccentric portion is when you’re moving with gravity. Exercises involving long static holds (like planks) are great for endurance, but they won’t amount to much muscle mass gained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot overemphasize how important good form is either - for avoiding injury, hardwiring the correct neural pathways, and maximizing muscle gain. Especially when you’re just starting out, choose light weights, and make sure optimal form comes naturally before you start increasing the intensity. It’s way easier learning it correctly the first time than fixing bad habits later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much food should you be eating? It varies widely between people. Start with your maintenance calories, add a couple hundred to that (it doesn’t have to be a lot!), and measure your results. Be patient with your progress - men can expect to gain 1-2lbs of lean muscle a month, and 0.5-1lbs for women (beginners may gain a little faster). Eating enough protein is also vital to gaining muscle - a general rule of thumb is around 1 gram of protein (each day) per pound of lean body weight (ie. how much you weigh, minus the amount of fat you have). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How do I get stronger?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It honestly depends on your experience level. If you’re just starting out, doing a normal resistance routine focused on gaining muscle will make you stronger. However, if you’ve been working out regularly for awhile (close to a year), using heavier weights (1-6 reps max) will help you get stronger a lot faster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re focusing more purely on strength gain, it’s important that each repetition is done as perfectly as possible (even moreso than for other training goals). That means stopping 1-2 reps shy of failure. Doing just one sloppy rep can severely impact your strength output for the rest of the workout. Don’t be afraid of taking longer rests between sets either (up to 2-3 minutes), as you want to be ready with as much energy as possible before you start your next set. It also goes without saying that heavier weight = greater chance for injury, and proper form will help prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Is it possible to lose fat and build muscle at the same time?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief - yes. Especially if you’re a beginner! Just make sure you’re eating around maintenance level calories (along with enough protein), doing resistance training 3-4 times a week, and you’ll start seeing body composition changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re significantly over/underweight, or have already been working out for some time, you’ll see much faster progress if you focus on one goal at a time. The main difference here is going to be diet - eating less if you’re trying to lose weight, or eating more if you’re trying to gain weight. Regular resistance training plays a part in both shedding fat and gaining muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How should I be structuring my workouts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the vast majority of people, full body workouts with compound exercises is the way to go. (For those who don’t know, compound exercises are those which use more than one joint at a time - think squats, bench press, rows, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popular back/chest/shoulders/arms/legs split routine (or any variation of it) is good for advanced bodybuilders, but not ideal for beginners. Bodybuilders exercise like this because they need a much greater stimulus to properly stress any given muscle group, and more rest between days training that muscle group as a result of their increased workout intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a beginner, it’s better to hit each muscle group multiple times a week (this is great to hasten learning and growth). You won’t need as long of a rest period before training the same muscle again, because it won’t be as fatigued after each workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compound exercises give you the greatest bang for your buck because you’re working out so many muscles in one movement (and burning way more calories at the same time). Isolation exercises (those working one joint at a time, like bicep curls or leg extensions) are best for bodybuilders who really need to hone in on a single muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing resistance training 3-4 times a week is a good goal to shoot for. Workouts should be around 45-60 minutes, with around 6-8 exercises done during that time. Try to keep rests between sets to around 60s (this is all very generalized, and can change depending on experience level and goal). Space rest days evenly between workouts if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start your workouts with the exercises which require the most energy (usually those which involve lifting the most weight), saving any isolation/ab exercises for the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like some help planning your workout routine, I just released a fitness app called &lt;a href=""https://www.perfect-fit.app/""&gt;PerfectFit&lt;/a&gt;. It gives you access to workouts designed by a personal trainer, all customized according to your unique goals, fitness level, and available equipment. There are tons of bodyweight exercises included - ideal for anyone working out at home! The app is currently available to download on Android, and iOS is hopefully just a few days away (currently under review).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What should I be eating?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your goal is a change in body composition (gaining muscle/losing fat), the amount of calories you’re consuming is the most important thing to pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re consistently working out hard but failing to gain/lose weight, chances are you need to make alterations to your diet. For weight loss, that usually means eating at a deficit of 250-500 calories per day; for weight gain, eating at a surplus of 200-300 calories per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What exact foods you’re eating has an impact on how easily you can stick to your calorie goals, as well as your energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consuming around 1 gram of protein per pound of lean bodyweight (per day) is a given, regardless of what your fitness goal is. This helps to maintain satiety, and preserve/increase muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating lots of fruits and veggies (as well as drinking 2-3L of water a day - more for some people) is a great way to feel full without consuming too many calories. It also just contributes to all-around health and energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating lots of fatty foods should be avoided if weight loss is the goal - not because fat makes you fat per se, but because they are so calorically dense. Only one tablespoon of peanut butter or olive oil is 100 calories! Conversely, if your goal is to &lt;strong&gt;gain&lt;/strong&gt; weight, adding more fatty foods to your diet (healthy fats, if possible) can help you hit that calorie goal easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And carbs? Not as evil as people make them out to be. Think of them as the energy that fuels your brain and your workouts. Having around 50% of your calories coming from carbs is about the norm. It’s likely beneficial to raise this number even higher if you’re an especially lean individual, or you’re regularly working out at intense levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;When should I be eating?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to time your meals properly is to think: “What will I be doing in the next 2-3 hours?” Eat according to the activity you’re about to do. That doesn’t mean you should be having a giant meal right before your workout, but ideally your biggest meal of the day would be several hours before you exercise. This will give you the energy you need, plus ensure the calories you consume are shuttled into your muscles instead of fat reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re about to do an intense workout, the best thing to eat beforehand (around 15-30 minutes prior) is a light snack of healthy carbs (like some fruit). For optimal recovery, aim for 20-30g of protein within an hour after you workout (if you miss this window though don’t worry about it). A protein shake is probably the simplest and most convenient way of doing this, but whole food is just as good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What supplements should I be taking?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a healthy, well-rounded diet, including 2-3 cups of different veggies each day,  enough protein per pound of bodyweight (from sources that include sufficient amounts of each essential amino acid), and adequate omega-3 fatty acids - then you’re golden, and probably don’t need any supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the vast majority of the population would probably benefit from a simple multivitamin and omega-3 supplement, just to help fill any nutritional gaps they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re getting enough protein from whole food, then you probably don’t need to add protein powder. However, if you’re struggling with this, then protein powder is a great way to easily increase your daily protein intake. Whey protein is the most bioavailable and has a complete amino acid profile, so it’s the best choice for most people. However, if you’re vegan (or lactose intolerant), there are lots of plant proteins available. You just need to pay attention to the amino acid profile of each one (possibly mixing and matching different plant sources if you need to).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for all the other supplements out there, it’s honestly on a case-by-case basis as to whether they’d actually help you or not. If you’re a beginner, unless you have any specific requirements or deficits, you probably don’t need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Is stretching important?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Please stretch (or do some other form of myofascial release, such as foam rolling), or you’ll eventually regret it. Regular exercise makes your muscles slowly form clumps of tissue and fascia. Neglecting to release these can result in restricted range of motion, and eventually pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static stretching should be done at the &lt;strong&gt;end&lt;/strong&gt; of your workout. Aim to stretch each worked muscle near its end range of motion for around 60s total. Don’t stretch before your workout, as this can impede strength output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Is warming up important?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Warming up is paramount to increasing blood flow and activating your muscles properly before you move onto more intense, metabolically demanding exercises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, during your warm-up, you should be actively moving your muscles through the same ranges of motion you’ll be doing for your workout. This can be as simple as doing the exact same movement, but with minimal weight - for example, doing a few sets of bodyweight squats before doing barbell squats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want your warm-ups to elevate your heart rate, but not be so intense that they start tiring you out and detract from your workout. Usually 5-10 minutes of light activity is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

,workout,"Hey, i've been working out fir years now and have tried multiple different routines. Currently i've been trying  Jeff Cavaliere's full body workout:    
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6gZoAzAhCg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6gZoAzAhCg) 

I started to dislike this routine because it did not allow me to train my upper chest and the lateral delts. After 2 months of using this routine, I came across a different full body routine from a youtuber called Jeremy Ethier:  
PART 1 -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JmWguyvu7Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JmWguyvu7Y)   
PART 2 -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWcJuLKB7RY&amp;t=485s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWcJuLKB7RY&amp;t=485s) 

They're both pretty simmilar, exept Jeremy has a few excercises that I think are more preferable. I think both routines are great, but I wanted to make one that took the best out of both of them. That's why I made a new plan that I think looks quite promising.

\---NEW PLAN---  
A:  
squat (glutes/quads)  
hip thrusts (glutes/hams)  
bench press (chest/triceps)  
chin ups (lats/biceps)  
lateral raises (lateral delts)  
face pulls (rear delts)

B:  
deadlift (glutes/hams)  
bulgarian split squat (glutes/quads)  
incline db bench press (upper chest/triceps)  
ohp (anterior and lateral delts/triceps)  
rows (traps/rhomboids/rear delts)  
banded db curls (biceps)  
\---

**I was hoping if anyone could help me make sure all of the excersizes are in the correct order?** The idea is to complete the most taxing workouts first, and then make your way down. 

Another thing I dislike about Jeff's routine is his sets and reps. Most of the excersizes have a 3x5 structure, when according to this site  [https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-many-reps-should-you-do.html](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-many-reps-should-you-do.html) the best rep range is between 8-12 reps for maximum muscle hypertrophy.

,workout,"Hi all, for those who have seen my last post here, I have been working hard to make gains and obtain muscle mass. After a few months of challenging myself to do more push ups and bicep/tricep exercises, I've noticed that my chest has expanded a little bit (which is good progress), but my left pec/side of my chest is a little bigger than my right. While it doesn't bother me too much, I'm a little concerned about it. Have I been doing something wrong? Is there a way to fix this? Another concern I have is my arms. Since my right arm is dominant, it's always been a little larger in size than my left arm. Once again, it doesn't bother me to the point where I'm annoyed, but I'd like to balance this out. 

The exercises I do for chest are: Regular Push ups, Chest Press Machine, Incline and Decline Pushups

The exercises I do for biceps/triceps are: Hammer Curls, Concentration Curls, Standing Dumbbell Curl, Zottoman Curl

So, I'm reaching out today to see if you guys have any suggestions as to how I can balance this out and make these muscles more proportionate in size. You can also read my previous post to see how my progress and for some context on how I'm doing. Keep in mind, I DO NOT have access to any indoor gym (although gyms are scheduled to open on Sep. 2 in NYC).

,workout,"Hi all, I am wanting to get back into exercising and could really use some guidance.

 For background, prior to covid I was seeing a trainer once a week for a little over a year and going to the gym 1-3 times a week outside of that session. I liked having the discipline and accountability of having a trainer, even if I wasn't feeling great (usually mentally) it still made me show up.

Now with covid, I've fallen out of a routine and into a bit of depression. I tried going to zoom work outs that my trainer was hosting but the timing was hard and I lost motivation after a couple months. My gym is allowing members to go in for training only and I'm honestly not comfortable doing so. I really liked my trainer but based on theirs and another trainers social medias I don't feel they're being safe.

Working out typically puts me in a good mood and helps me manage anxiety and depression. I just feel overwhelmed right now and don't know where to restart.

I was wondering if there are apps that you would recommend for a good workout but also have some level of motivation and accountability built into it? (May be asking for too much?) 

Alternatively, I recently came across the Tempo Home Gym. It's pretty expensive and has a monthly membership on top of it but I like the AI integration and that is corrects your form and makes recommendations. Has anyone purchased this or have thoughts around it?

Between gym membership and training, I was spending about $200 a month. My work also offers a $500 health and wellness stipend each year. So out of pocket I was investing about $1900 a year in to my health and fitness, I would like to not spend more than that unless it's some miracle app or machine but ideally saving a little money would be best.

Apologies for such a long post, I am just hoping to find a little guidance after drowning in Google searches and being discouraged for the past couple months. Thank you as well for any help.",t2_7kko54to,False,,0,False,Home Workout: Apps vs AI Mirrors,[],r/workout,False,6,standard,0,,False,t3_ii6xlg,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Equipment Help,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598649767.0,text,6,,,text,self.workout,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I am wanting to get back into exercising and could really use some guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For background, prior to covid I was seeing a trainer once a week for a little over a year and going to the gym 1-3 times a week outside of that session. I liked having the discipline and accountability of having a trainer, even if I wasn&amp;#39;t feeling great (usually mentally) it still made me show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with covid, I&amp;#39;ve fallen out of a routine and into a bit of depression. I tried going to zoom work outs that my trainer was hosting but the timing was hard and I lost motivation after a couple months. My gym is allowing members to go in for training only and I&amp;#39;m honestly not comfortable doing so. I really liked my trainer but based on theirs and another trainers social medias I don&amp;#39;t feel they&amp;#39;re being safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working out typically puts me in a good mood and helps me manage anxiety and depression. I just feel overwhelmed right now and don&amp;#39;t know where to restart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if there are apps that you would recommend for a good workout but also have some level of motivation and accountability built into it? (May be asking for too much?) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, I recently came across the Tempo Home Gym. It&amp;#39;s pretty expensive and has a monthly membership on top of it but I like the AI integration and that is corrects your form and makes recommendations. Has anyone purchased this or have thoughts around it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between gym membership and training, I was spending about $200 a month. My work also offers a $500 health and wellness stipend each year. So out of pocket I was investing about $1900 a year in to my health and fitness, I would like to not spend more than that unless it&amp;#39;s some miracle app or machine but ideally saving a little money would be best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies for such a long post, I am just hoping to find a little guidance after drowning in Google searches and being discouraged for the past couple months. Thank you as well for any help.&lt;/p&gt;

I eat \~1500 calories a day, late breakfast i have 1 cup of egg whites, with a less than a teaspoon of avacado oil and maybe a quarter cup of cheese-- less than 300 calories. for lunch i have a protein shake and milk, syntha 6 140 calories + milk 130--270 calories. For dinner it fluctuates of course but i'm usually sitting at about 600-700 calories. then i have another protein shake late at night +270 all in all about 1500 calories.

I have a bit larger... ‘soft’ thighs(more inner thigh than outer). And I want to tone them SO BADLY as well as tone my calves. 

Has anyone had experience with leg exercises that worked at home? Can I get some tips? 

Also, do you eat before or after workout? And how do protein shakes work? And is meal timing important?

Anyways, I'm also working out alone, so I've been staying away from things like barbell bench press due to the fact that I'm working out alone, and don't wanna fail while alone.

I don't have much experience with leg workouts either, as I was slacking on that when I used to work out, but I'm definitely going to start doing that more now.

,workout,"I'm 20yo, male, 5'6, and currently weight just about 200lbs naked. But all of that weight is in my belly and upper legs.

I've never desired to be thin, even when I was I didn't really pay it much mind. I've always said if I had to choose between my weight and my strength, I'd choose strength every time. Back when I was in highschool, I did some powerlifting and got *denser* and I loved it. Didn't gain any height but put on about 20-25lbs of muscle in 6 months. My shoulders/pecks filled out and my trunk became unstoppable. I was dead lifting twice a week, benching my own body weight, rock climbing, etc.

Well, fast forward 2-3 years and now I'm not strong I'm just fat. When I graduated highschool I stopped lifting and despite my attempts to maintain a gym schedule over the summer and then at college, I just couldn't do it without the structure of highschool. I also went on some medication for all of a few months but managed to put about 40lbs onto my gut due to it and that has never gone away.

with this pandemic I've actually *increased* my exercise by introducing some equipmentless stuff into my daily routine: pushups, planks, and squats. But my efforts have been frequently de-railed by trips out of town, injuries (not workout related), and my bad sleep schedule. My goal once my most recent wound heals is to rotate squats --&gt; planks --&gt; pushups in a 3 day cycle, doing each exercise throughout the day for the whole day.

---

I strive to eat healthy and by a lot of accounts I do. I don't eat a lot of junky food like hot dogs, pizza, microwavable meals, and I don't consume a lot of gluten. I also don't drink any sugar, just unsweetened green tea by the quart, and water if I don't have that. I can't recall the last time I've bought soda or fruit juice. I cook a lot, especially now during the pandemic. Rice, potatoes, roasted/stir-fried veggies, fresh corn. Primary meats are chicken, salmon, and lamb in that order. My snacks are stuff like peanut butter, cheese, lunch meats, varieties of chips/crackers.

My biggest struggles diet wise are A) eating big and staying full. I'm constantly grazing on stuff I can eat quickly and easily. I've combated this by maintaining a fasting period (14-16 hours most days) recently, and just allotting more effort into cooking. But even when I cook a big meal I struggle to eat the protein and vacuum up the carb instead. and B) leafy greens. I hate salads and don't like any plain leafy green like spinach, lettuce, or kale. I'll cook with cabbage but that has the nutritional value of paper and is just a filler for stir fries. Actually, when I said I don't like spinach that's was a lie. fully mature, fresh spinach I'll eat with the silt on right out of the ground. But that baby stuff that's already multiple days old and was harvested before it was ready that they have in the super market is terrible.

With all of that in mind, what I want is simple: weight numbers and endurance. I want to be able to get through a day of hard labor. I want to be able to lift a heavy object off of the ground, or push something heavy across the room. I don't really care what I look like, up to and including the world's largest beer gut.

50 burpees (non-crossfit version)

100 squats

5 \* 30s planks

5\* 30s mountain climbers

50 half push ups(I still can't do a full push up )

5\*30s bicycle crunches

5\* 30s bridges

,workout," Hello, so, I'm a 25yo male, 170cm tall, currently at 73kg, looking to cut down to 65kg before starting to bulk

What I've been doing recently, at home is: **pushups**, **situps**, **dumbbell curls**, **squats** and whatever comes to mind on a given day and I'll do this **3 days in a row, the 4th day I'll do boxing for cardio, 5th day rest**, rinse and repeat.

Now, doing only these exercises is wrong, that I know, but I can easily do different ones, as I've done a lot of different exercises in the past, **the THING that's bugging me**, is the schedule itself, because all around me, most people I know, won't work the same body parts days in a row. They'll do **chest day, legs day, core day,** whatever.

**TLDR**: I'd like to switch from doing whole body workouts 3 days in a row, to working on specific body parts if that is better, can you guys give me a little help? Like, how should I split it? Is 3 days muscles, 1 cardio, 1 rest, good? Would Chest/Shoulders &gt; Biceps/Triceps &gt; Legs &gt; Cardio &gt; Rest be good? Or at least better than doing whole body days in a row?

,workout,"Hi!

I have been following workout routine from youtube 5 times a week (10-15min everytime) for a few months now to get a smaller waist, I dont use any weights other than just my body however I have been reading recently that these exercises can cause your obliques to grow, thus increasing the size of your waist. Im a bit skeptical to whether or not the exercises could do much difference alone without weights, I personally cant tell if my obliques have grown cause I have lost weight in the process. So my question is, could doing these exercises regularly cause an increase in oblique size therefore, waist even if a little bit?

Thank youu!!

,workout,"This morning I went for my first run in 3 weeks. I do intermediate walk/run with a 30 second sprint at the end. (My goal is to be able to run for a full 30 minutes by the end of the year)

I took some time off because band camp started and I didn't want to do a work out then go and march for 8 hours. Anyways, band camp is over and I'm getting back into my old schedule.

After my run I felt very nauseous. I first thought it was because I had a glass of water before I left for my run, but looking back I figured out pretty quickly that I was dehydrated. So far I've drank about 6 cups of water to at least replenish myself and I still feel nauseous. (Granted I had a small thing of fries because I was starving after my shift went through lunchtime)

How long does post run nausea last? Should I go for a run again tomorrow morning even if I'm feeling better? And what should I be eating/drinking to avoid future nausea?

Update: I took someone's advice and ate a banana before going for my morning run. Halfway through my run my stomach started to cramp and I had to slow to a walk or else the pain would get worse. I drank a protein shake after the pain subsided and took a shower. I don't feel nauseous in the slightest.

,workout,"So, I've been underweight my whole life and every time I try to hit the gym and eat more its very hard to stay consistent. I was good at getting in the gym when the gym was open, but It takes a lot for me to gain weight off of working out alone. It's eating more that is truly the challenging part for me. Especially because I never had actual meal plans or workout routines. I used to get assistance from Golds Gym for nutritional tips and workouts, but it's very expensive so I don't have those resources anymore. I also used to be in a meal plan that makes your weekly meals for you, but it was also very expensive. Now I want to try and have my own workout routine and a good meal plan in order to gain weight, but I know nothing about either. Can anyone assist me with their personal meal prep and work out schedule? Or any resources I can use that are free? I tried doing this off of research but just got overwhelmed.

I was good at getting in the gym when the gym was open, but It takes a lot for me to gain weight off of working out alone. It&amp;#39;s eating more that is truly the challenging part for me. Especially because I never had actual meal plans or workout routines. I used to get assistance from Golds Gym for nutritional tips and workouts, but it&amp;#39;s very expensive so I don&amp;#39;t have those resources anymore. I also used to be in a meal plan that makes your weekly meals for you, but it was also very expensive. Now I want to try and have my own workout routine and a good meal plan in order to gain weight, but I know nothing about either. Can anyone assist me with their personal meal prep and work out schedule? Or any resources I can use that are free? I tried doing this off of research but just got overwhelmed.

,workout,"I'm 6'6, 275lbs, size 17.5 shoe, a big guy; When lockdown hit, I decided to be proactive, finally decided to fulfil my goal to look big and defined. I hired a dietician for a month who really helped me muscle up and I gained about 23 lbs of muscle and fat in the process. My whole life, I wanted to look like a rugby player, and I do in a slight perversion of the ideal---I look like those guys who come into camp 20lbs under and the GM just puts them on a straight diet of rice, potato and mass-gainer, so not muscular, not fat. I do 38 minutes at level 9 on the recumbent bike every day which is where my body gives up. But, I still have this lower ab belly I can't seem to shed. Before you ask, my diet is there, it's tweaked to perfection balancing what I can afford and what my body needs to succeed.

During May I ran every day, just all the way up this public-mall behind my house, and down the suburban street adjacent to it and back to my place, nice 1.1km.

I hired a dietician for a month who really helped me muscle up and I gained about 23 lbs of muscle and fat in the process. My whole life, I wanted to look like a rugby player, and I do in a slight perversion of the ideal---I look like those guys who come into camp 20lbs under and the GM just puts them on a straight diet of rice, potato and mass-gainer, so not muscular, not fat. I do 38 minutes at level 9 on the recumbent bike every day which is where my body gives up. But, I still have this lower ab belly I can&amp;#39;t seem to shed. Before you ask, my diet is there, it&amp;#39;s tweaked to perfection balancing what I can afford and what my body needs to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During May I ran every day, just all the way up this public-mall behind my house, and down the suburban street adjacent to it and back to my place, nice 1.1km.

I am a 28 year old male at 90kg and looking to lose 15kg by best case December 2020 (posting this on 23 August 2020). The only home equipment I have available are
2 x 15kg dumbbells
Spinbike
Yoga mat

The workout I want to do looks like the following:

Dumbbell curls - 5 sets of 12-20 reps 

Seated overhead tricep extension - 5 sets of 12-20 reps

Hammer curls - 5 sets of 12-20 reps 

Standing shoulder press - 5 sets of 12-20 reps

Lying dumbbell press - 5 sets of 12-20 reps

Dumbbell squats - 5 sets of 20+ reps


All of the above exercises are performed at 10kg but will move to maximum 15kg after a few weeks. I don't plan on buying more weights so I'm going to opt for more reps per set instead (should I be doing more reps than I indicated in my routine above?)

&lt;p&gt;Been doing a made up workout this whole time, my progress has been good but I’m aware I’m doing a rubbish workout. I do 10x15 sets of butterfly kicks, 10x50 sets crunches, 5x25 dumbbell squats, 5x50 squats, 15x15 sets of 5KG dumbbell curls and 5x20 kettlebell swings. I do 4 days on one day off repeat, but again that’s annoying because it doesn’t fit into a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started doing some Nike training workouts instead, did a 20 min tank top arms workout, which was really good I felt the burn and pushed myself. But I can’t find a good ab workout where I’m actually feeling the burn in my abs in the same way, my form is slightly off on new workouts and I’m worried my progress will go backwards, does anyone have any recommendations on a hard hitting ab workout? I workout at home have 8KG kettlebell, 2x 5KG dumbells, I’m not ready to go up on weight just yet as the new arms workout is still quite hard.&lt;/p&gt;

,workout," 

Hey Everybody. Hope you are all staying safe out there.

I am starting to get back into routinely working out. Little info about me. I'm 5'11. 150 pounds. stick-figured. I've played soccer my whole life. I'm 27 and still play twice a week. I suffer a lot from depression so I've formed a lot of bad habits throughout the years. I hired a new trainer that I know will do a good job pushing me. He's a personal friend and well known around the area so I have the motivation to keep this going. One of those bad habits is due to long hours, I would work 12+ hours and only have the chance to eat one big meal a day and then a few small snacks. I've been like that for a while now. I know it's bad lol. I usually eat very unhealthily too which I know doesn't help. I know due to eating once/twice a day I am usually never feeling hungry so it's very hard to force myself to eat at times like that. If I do eat when I'm not hungry, it has to be something small so I don't feel sicker. I usually just wait until I get that big hunger feeling later on in the day. My two goals are to obviously create a way better diet and get back on the path of eating correctly. The other goal is I want to gain muscle. I don't want to get swoll and jacked, but I want to have some noticeable muscles. I don't want the sticks anymore lol. I want my ex to get mad haha. My workout routine will be training with him for 2 days, 2 days playing soccer. 1 day at the personal gym.

With all of that being said, I do plan on obviously making some big diet changes, I want to start eating more and get back into the normal eating routines. I want to eat healthier and all of that. What is the best way to go about that? How do I slowly start to eat more? I know the main thing is to eat more and more small things until you start building up an appetite but should I look into meal replacements to help guide me? I am not looking to replace any meals, I just want to make sure I am getting what my body needs in order to ensure that my workout is actually helping my body and I'm getting bigger. I plan on making whole foods each day now. I am just curious as to maybe for the start, a replacement meal + whole foods would be a good way to start achieving that first goal? Then once I start eating more and more I can start to take off the replacement shakes and then rely on whole foods. Because of my bad habits, I would really prefer not to do replacement shakes as to the fear I might go to them a little too much. I am not against using them though a short time if it will be beneficial to my workout and diet change. I plan on tracking what I eat for the most part. I'm not going to go crazy but I'll record most things. 

I do plan on doing post-workout shakes too! Phormula-1 and Ignition are the two that I have. I am also throwing in some Creatine as well. Any helpful information would be awesome! I'm a beginner when it comes to the gym so please go easy! I'm also pretty picky when it comes to food so any flavor recommendations on anything would be awesome. I'm also not trying to break the bank too. I know a lot of products out there are very expensive. I would like to stick with just post-workout shakes if I can.

,workout,"I started working out about three weeks or a month ago, so I'm pretty much a beginner. I'm not really sure about my routine if it works, but I'm mostly just aiming to burn belly fat.

My diet consists of a high-carb and protein brunch (cause I usually wake up late), and have a protein and fibre dinner.

I do three different workouts and they are the following:

1) Mostly Weights (found this on Gymshark)

3 SETS, 30s per exercise, 15s rest
-Squat Alternate Hammer Press
-Alternate Curtsy Lunge Bicep Curl
-Floor Press to Cycle
-Situps


2) HIIT Belly/Abs

2-3 SETS, 45s per exercise, 15s rest
-Burpees w/ Pushups
-Mountain Climbers
-Squats
-Lunges
-High Knees
-Elbow Plank


3) Core Workout

2-3 SETS, 30s per exercise, 15s rest
-Leg Flutters
-Russian Twists
-Leg Raises
-Situps
-Jumping Jacks
-High Knees
-Plank Side to Side
-Side Plank Hip Raises
-Mountain Climbers
-Bicycle Crunches

I only have access to a dumbbell and bench press at home and would like to potentially incorporate some machines and gym equipment  if it would be more beneficial. I also have some questions about my sets and reps for some exercise I do now. Here is my current workout:

&amp;#x200B;

Push:

\-Bench press 5 x 8, I feel as if I should definitely change up my sets and reps for this exercise but not sure

\-DB bench press/ incline db press 4 x 12,

\-Shoulder press/ Arnold shoulder press 4 x 12

\-side raises 4 x 15 with lighter weight, could use a better second shoulder exercise

\-overhead tricep extensions 4 x 12, I struggle with tricep exercises with db's so hoping to find some replacements

&amp;#x200B;

Pull:

\-Pull ups / chin ups 3 x 8

\-barbell row 4 x 12

\-barbell curl 4 x 8

\-hammer curl / concentration curl 4 x 12

\-shrugs 4 x 12, I have trouble with this exercise and feel like I dont work these muscles very well

&amp;#x200B;

Legs:

\-DB squat 4 x 15, didn't have enough weight so had to do more reps, plan on switching to proper squat rack

\-RDL 4 x 12

\-lunges/bulgarian split squat 4 x 12

\-stair calf raises 4 x 15

&amp;#x200B;

,workout,"Hi guys!

I just decided to start taking care of my body. My first goal is to create a habit. So I took a look around the house, found some stuff, and created a routine based on what was available.

Right now I'm doing the following, six days a week:  


* 5x100 skipping rope
* 5x10 body weight exercises (rotate between push-ups, burpees, sit-ups etc)
* 5x15 exercises with a 12 kg kettlebell (soon moving up to 16 kg)

I'm 178 cm / 75 kg and I've done this for some time now. I \_feel\_ great. My question is, does this workout affect my body at all?

I really like that it is so accessible. I can just take a brisk walk around the neighborhood and then do the entire routine on my lawn. But I guess I have to, at some point in time, start going to the gym.

I understand that it is very hard to give an answer, but I want to know if a routine like this does anything at all to a normal body (e.g. not overweight or anything).

,workout,"Hey guys,

i want to get a better overview about my data. Hope you can help with it.

So i am wearing a Samsung Gear fit 2. It is paired with my Samsung S20 phone.  
I got the strava app on the Gear fit and on the phone. It syncs the runs very well from the Gear fit to my strava.

But i also want to look at my steps, pulse etc. Now i can only see in in the gear fit, which isn´t very comfortable and in the Samsung Health app.

And i got a scale / body analyzer thingy from withings. They use an app called ""Health Mate"". It protocols my weight and body fat. But i dont find an option to sync it with Samsung Health..

For lifting i use an app called progression. This app can only sync to google fit i think.

Is there any chance i get all those data together on one nice site / app? Can you recommend on?  
google fit? Samsung health? 

I haven´t looked into google fit, bc i am already pretty confused at this point and i am sure you guys can recommend be the right tool, before i lose my mind. Btw i dont care much about the privacy of my data at this point.

The number of reps seems very high for a beginner. But, this routine, seems to lack back muscles workout in my opinion. I like the aspect of daily training, it creates a habit, a system in life. I am in favour of daily full body workouts rather than 3 times a week grinding to near death.

Anyone has experience with these sort of daily full body workouts which make you strong and flexible and don't take up a huge chunk of your day? I know there are routines out there from multiple sources each claiming to be the best. I don't want to buy into those. I want to hear from real experiences and their routines.

Edit 1: BTW, by strong and flexible I mean functionally strong and flexible with healthy joints. So I am mainly looking for people with calisthenics experiences.

,workout,"Hi all, I'm new to Reddit, so bear with me for this one. I'm an 18 year old male, I'm 5'11, and I weigh about 130 pounds. I know, I'm skinny for someone of my height and weight, so I've been trying to gain muscle mass this whole year. Unfortunately, due to COVID 19, my local gym is closed, forcing me to workout at home with no equipment, except for a 12 lb dumbbell and a pair of hand grips. However, there is an outdoor gym in my city that I go to that has a pull bar and a machine that targets the biceps.

Each day is reserved for working out a different part of my body, in this order: Biceps, Triceps, Chest, Abs, Legs. For each exercise I do, I do 5 sets of 20 reps, 4 sets of 25 reps, 3 sets of 30 reps, 2 sets of 35 reps, and 1 set of 40 reps. The specific exercises are as follows:

Biceps: Hammer Curls, Concentration Curls, Standing Dumbbell Curl, Zottoman Curl

Triceps: Bench Dips, Pull Ups

Chest: I start by doing 10 regular pushups, then 10 decline push ups. Then I do 9 of each, then 8, and so on until I reach 1, equaling to 110 push ups overall. After that, I do regular pushups with the standard routine (5 sets of 20, 4 sets of 25, so on).

Abs: Regular Sit Ups, Bicycle Crunches, Dumbbell Twist (same idea as Medicine Ball Twist, but with my dumbbell instead)

Legs: Bulgarian Split Squats, Regular Squats

As for diet, I've been trying to eat a lot of foods rich with protein, which includes eggs, chicken, rice, and lasagna. I also mix some Muscle Milk protein powder with my juice/milk after each workout. While I have been showing some considerable gains, particularly my chest since it has expanded, I'm still quite skinny and not making as much gains as I would like. So, I'm reaching out today for advice on how to make gains.

,workout,"Hi

Before I start read all, there may be a detail here that will solve my question, without me knowing. 

Im 18 years old and weigh 77.1 kg. I have been running for two years now. I love it a lot but I want to grow upperbody muscle. 

I start with running my usual 5 km or 3km run (depends on what day it is) and then I stretch. Pretty basic. 5 days a week. 

Everytime I have started to workout my upper body, I have seen no results. Two times I workouted for 6 weeks, with little to no result. 

I am tired and feel demotiveted to start again. 

My main goal is visual abs and bigger arms. But in general upperbody

So here is my first question: Has my running ruined my progress?

If so, is there any product I can take that makes sure that I don’t burn muscle? 

Should I try Protein powder or any other products? 

How long should a muscle workout last? I often get tired early. 

Any workoutroutine that fits me?

,workout,"Hi, everyone. 

I am a 17-years-old male, who has been working out for five months. Every day I do 7x20 push-ups, 5x80 sit-ups, 3x70 squats. 

I am a vegan and eat healthy, I try to include as much natural protein as possible. I do not take any supplements, nor do I want to. 

In these five months I have gained some muscle, but I was expecting to gain more. I know that building your body takes years and decades, but I just seem to gain way too little muscle, so I want to ask IS IT BECAUSE I WORK OUT EVERY SINGLE DAY? I know, that muscles need to recover and one should have a rest day, but I don't think I need to take rest days as I do not really work out much, first of all because I am a beginner and second of all, I have dealt with anorexia and EDNOS for years before starting to work out. I decided to start working out in the very first place because I was completely recovered physically. 

I will be really glad if someone helps me out! You can also give me some tips about working out in general, I will be very grateful!

because of COVID-19 the gyms aren't going to be open for a while (or i'm not 100% comfy with them) and where i live the winters are really cold and start relatively early so i'm not going to be able to get outdoor exercise for a while.

anyways, i want to be able to keep up cardio and i have enough money saved up where i can afford a small cardio machine. it doesn't need to be the best, but i need something that i can consistently do most days.

currently, i'm trying to decide between a bike trainer and a folding treadmill. i'm looking for something around $500 but i could go with something up to like $800 if necessary. my room is also not massive (8ft by 12ft including a double bed and a desk) so i would also appreciate something small-ish, or that's easy to put away.

,workout,"Hey folks,

i am trying to get back in shape. Had a really good one some years ago, but lost it to laziness after getting into a long term realtionship...somebody knows that feeling? ;-)  
I am now lifting every other day again for some time and i also started running again. I am reading a lot about fitness, eating etc. I need to lose weight and also want my muscles back. It´s a long way to go but so far i am enjoying the sweaty journey. 

Unfortunately i have noone to really talk about that topic, because family and friends are not much interested in these kind of things....so i hope to find an online buddy here. Maybe you are on a similar journey?  
It would be nice to have someone i could tell about my new Deadlift PR or how i went for a run altough it was raining cats and dogs, how i did my 10.000 Steps for 3 weeks every day etc.  
And for sure i want to know about YOUR goals, achievments and problems.

If one of us starts beeing lazy the other person can motivate him, we can exchange training plans or kinda compete. This would mean regular conversation (pref. Whatsapp).

Some information about me so that you know who you would engange with:   
I am a 29yo male from germany. I am married and working in an office job.   
I am 1,98m tall ( 6″6 ) and my weight is 120kg ( 264 pound ) probably about 35% body fat.  
2013 i was 100kg ( 220 pound ) with 10% body fat.

It is not important for me where you come from. I am very open minded and interested in different cultures etc.

So will you be my online workout buddy, my digital pen pal or whatever you want to call it?

Have a good one!

2. Goblet Squats
3. Dumbbells curls 
4. Chest press
5. Seesaw shoulder press
6. RDL with dumbbells 
7. overhead triceps extension 
8.  upright row

I was recently able to finally understand squeezing the glutes thanks to a cue I found on Reddit about trying to mimic turning out the toes without actually turning them out (guess who was always squeezing the anus prior to that 🙄🙄🙄🙄). 

So Reddit, please help me squeeze my chest 😂😂😂. I don't understand the cue ""imagine you're trying to squeeze a pencil"". Where is the pencil? On my cleavage? My cleavage is too big to be able to squeeze a pencil there.

,workout,"Hi all, I am looking for a good workout to use with my resistance bands that I bought (total resistance weight is 105lb across 5 bands).  My ultimate goal is to be able to do a set of 10 chin ups (not even close to being able to pull this off). 

Currently, I am following this routine 3 times a week (sun, tues, thurs) 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrn2cbrFHTQ

along with this, i try to do 3 sets of 10 of the following:

drag curls

close grip curls

standing fly

standing press

standing band row

standing rope pulldowns

pushups

For my legs, I attempt some of the exercises from this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76VpyX5AHEI

unfortunately, I don't do them all (i exclude the 'sumo squats', sitting crunches and spiderman crunches).  I do these on mon, wed, fri.

I feel like some of the leg exersizes are harder to do with the band, because i'd like to put more weight on, but then can't pull up the bands in the correct position.  (for example the sumo squats hurt my thumbs if i try to use too many bands.)

My rest day is saturday.

Along with this, i try to drink one thing of protein after each workout.  

My question is, are these good enough exercises to try to get strength?  should I be doing more/less (for example, am i doing too many variations of curls: regular, close grip, drag)? Am I not doing enough leg exercises?  I am open to suggestions on how i might be able to streamline my process if I can.

Also, when's the best time to drink a protien shake?

,workout,"Hey all, first time on this subreddit since I usually experiment with making my own programs based off of what other qualified people put out on the internet. **Post is going to be long, so I appreciate whoever reads it all the way through!**  


&amp;#x200B;

**IF THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT PLACE TO POST, please lmk where to post this! :)**  


&amp;#x200B;

Backstory (numbers are in no way to flex, I just think that the information could be handy on recommendations for intensity, etc.).

1. Been doing competitive long distance running since the 4th grade up to when I graduated university.
2. Started seriously lifting ever since I started university. So I guess I have **4 years of experience?** I've **taken breaks of varying months when school stopped since I got lazy (yes I know this is bad).**
3. High school weight: **145LB** with little to no muscle, but also little to no fat (skinny abs). **Best mile time: 4:58**
4. University weight: varying between **153 to 165LB**, more muscle, not too big, good balance of muscle and fat. **Best mile time: 5:11**
5. Right now: last I checked 2 weeks ago I was **180LB. Best mile time: 6:23.** Weight is mostly due to bad habits, COVID-induced depression, and COVID-induced laziness **(not an excuse, but it's the best I can come up with for the sake of this post).**
   1. But now as an adult that has been released from the crutches of education, I don't have the free time to go to the gym everyday. I've done full body workouts as a way to recomp/recondition my body for workouts when I'm off of long breaks, but now, I feel like all I can do are full body workouts--since I also need to throw in long distance and sprinting workouts in between.
   2. Been currently doing my listed workout for about 2 weeks now
   3. **I am currently 5'9""**  


&amp;#x200B;

**GOAL: To hit as many muscles as possible with a mix of endurance, power, and speed/explosiveness. Current duration of my workout is about 2 hours**  


&amp;#x200B;

Workouts are a variation of 3x8, 2x8, and 4x5 with progressively increasing weight with the exception of calf raises (4x20, 3x15, 2x10) and a couple of other exercises when appropriate. I also do pushups 3 sets to failure every 2 days.  


In the exact order, my current workout I have 3 days a week is:

1. **Dumbbell squat jumps**
2. **Clean and jerk**
3. **Deadlift**
4. RDL
5. **Lu raises (doing them with dumbbells instead of plates)**
6. **Lateral and front combination raises (lateral then moving to front, down, then back = 1 rep)**
7. Lat pull-downs and lateral rows
8. **Bench press**
9. Dumbbell skullcrushers
10. Standing Arnold Press
11. Dumbbell curls
12. Zottman curls
13. Forearm curls and reverse forearm curls (palm facing down)
14. Front dumbbell holds 30 seconds
15. **Dragonflags 3x5**
16. **Ab wheel (able to do them standing, but not at the moment)**
17. Planks 1 minute each (both sides and traditional position)
18. **Goblet squat**
19. **Barbell squat**
20. **Calf raises**

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IF THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT PLACE TO POST, please lmk where to post this! :)&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backstory (numbers are in no way to flex, I just think that the information could be handy on recommendations for intensity, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been doing competitive long distance running since the 4th grade up to when I graduated university.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started seriously lifting ever since I started university. So I guess I have &lt;strong&gt;4 years of experience?&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve &lt;strong&gt;taken breaks of varying months when school stopped since I got lazy (yes I know this is bad).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High school weight: &lt;strong&gt;145LB&lt;/strong&gt; with little to no muscle, but also little to no fat (skinny abs). &lt;strong&gt;Best mile time: 4:58&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;University weight: varying between &lt;strong&gt;153 to 165LB&lt;/strong&gt;, more muscle, not too big, good balance of muscle and fat. &lt;strong&gt;Best mile time: 5:11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right now: last I checked 2 weeks ago I was &lt;strong&gt;180LB. Best mile time: 6:23.&lt;/strong&gt; Weight is mostly due to bad habits, COVID-induced depression, and COVID-induced laziness &lt;strong&gt;(not an excuse, but it&amp;#39;s the best I can come up with for the sake of this post).&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But now as an adult that has been released from the crutches of education, I don&amp;#39;t have the free time to go to the gym everyday. I&amp;#39;ve done full body workouts as a way to recomp/recondition my body for workouts when I&amp;#39;m off of long breaks, but now, I feel like all I can do are full body workouts--since I also need to throw in long distance and sprinting workouts in between.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been currently doing my listed workout for about 2 weeks now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am currently 5&amp;#39;9&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOAL: To hit as many muscles as possible with a mix of endurance, power, and speed/explosiveness. Current duration of my workout is about 2 hours&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workouts are a variation of 3x8, 2x8, and 4x5 with progressively increasing weight with the exception of calf raises (4x20, 3x15, 2x10) and a couple of other exercises when appropriate. I also do pushups 3 sets to failure every 2 days.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the exact order, my current workout I have 3 days a week is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dumbbell squat jumps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean and jerk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadlift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RDL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lu raises (doing them with dumbbells instead of plates)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lateral and front combination raises (lateral then moving to front, down, then back = 1 rep)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lat pull-downs and lateral rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bench press&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dumbbell skullcrushers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing Arnold Press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dumbbell curls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zottman curls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forearm curls and reverse forearm curls (palm facing down)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front dumbbell holds 30 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragonflags 3x5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ab wheel (able to do them standing, but not at the moment)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planks 1 minute each (both sides and traditional position)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goblet squat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbell squat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calf raises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this in mind, what are other exercises I can include? What should I swap out? Bolded exercises are ones I am not willing to swap out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all,

I'm not a fitness guru or anything but I've been following many youtube workouts for years, here's examples of youtubers I have tried: Blogilates, HASfit, FitnessBlender, Chris Heria, Chloe Ting, Pamela Reif, Madfit...

Of all channels I've tried, I liked Chris Heria's workouts the most because it is effective and he explained how to do the workouts properly, but I am not trying to get into calisthenics or anything.. so some of the workouts were too difficult for me.

As a person who's trying to be fit (not trying to muscular), I'd like to see if there's recommendations/programmes that I can really try out. My goal is to gain strength and stay fit. This is on top of other exercises I do in life (e.g. running, swimming).

,workout,"Hey everyone.

I'm trying to establish a weekly workout beginner plan of my own and would like to get some feedback if possible. I don't know if it makes much sense like this but I'll try to describe my goals and what I do.

The goals are pretty basic, lose weight, improve fitness and become constant. Before that I had either being just going for a run or doing a jump rope workout but not in an organized constant manner. Sometimes I would say ""oh no it might rain today"" or ""shit its too hot"" but not anymore. Now I'll either get wet or my buns will be on fire but I just try to stick to it.
Thus I have been sticking to the following routine for the past 3 weeks:

Monday - Jump Rope Dudes beginners workout: this consists of a set of 20 seconds work, 10 seconds rest. There should be 20 reps of jumping rope and 20 of body weight exercises with the 10 rest in between

Tuesday - go for a 5k run after work (not much but you gotta start with something)

Wednesday - chill (I'm not the fittest dude so I think one day to rest in between is good)

Thursday - 5k run

Friday - JRD beginners workout

Weekend - chill and have fun. Some Sundays I go for a run with my wife.

So I would like to improve my endurance and lose weight as well as to be able to increase to 5 days of training every week. Needles to say I'll be trying to bump it up to 6k in a week or two if possible. I know it is integral to stop eating like a fucking pre-hybernation bear and more like a human being in order to actually lose weight in a healthy way.

,workout,"I'm a 21 yr old guy.

I used to run and play football around 3-4 years back so I was in shape, had worked out a little back then which gave me slight biceps and shaped my chest a little but since then I've put on some fat around my waist and abdomen fat.


Currently I climb 20 floors of my building 2 steps at a time and I go for a walk.


There comes a phase of a few weeks where I exercise like crunches situps and lift weights but yeah one break and I stop completely.


I'm really disturbed about my midriff and its affecting me a lot so I started climbing stairs everyday for the past 2 weeks . I was curious as to whether there are any exercises which are specifically for the abdomen and waist regions so that I can try to lose that fat and then go on to strength training .

,workout,"Hi All,

So over the last few months this https://imgur.com/WJkKaIN has been my weekly 'plan'. Im a 29m beginner but have been following my brother who has been acting as a semi coach and guide as we workout together in his gym

Some of it has been really easy to stick to and other parts have failed pretty hard.

The biggest thing that failed was a 6 day plan, i found that i like having a rest day sunday so that Im fresh for Monday and dont build up too much fatigue. But mostly found that 2 rest days made my overall fatigue much better.

The problem is to do this I just started skipping the 6th session, but am struggling to find a way to get everything in.

The other thing I feel like im neglecting are certain exercises, mainly deadlifts, Lateral raise. But again where do i add these? The reason military press is on leg day is already to compensate for fatigues on push day. And pull day is pretty solidly booked. 

Ive been off work due to covid but am returning soon and will have to find a way to cut the quantity down while still getting enough work in..

Any and all criticism is welcomed , I want to improve, and I want to understand what im doing wrong.

Throughout the years I've realized that I've never given my 100% when I workout

I really do want to tho 

What I mean is that I've alwayse sprinted through my workout plan like it was a shore list. Get in the Gym, do the list, get out. Easy and simple. This phenomenon amplified a lot following my army training. 


Every time I do the least bit of workout. I am unable to go all out. My body and my mind tell me Everytime to slow down and/or push less to make sure I finish the hour/set/distance/rep because their might be another activity that I would need energy right after that. 

(For those who haven't had base army training, a simple example would be push ups. Anytime anywhere for any reason we would start doing push ups. 15? 40? 50? We never knew when and how much. So I kept doing the least bit to try to survive all of these pushe ups because their might be some later on)

,workout,"Hello guys,

Let me quickly tell you my story before i ask my question.
Since i was a little child i was fat and 2 years ago i hit my highest weight and it was my wake up call. I reached 124 kgs and started going to dietitian and doing exercise, in nearly a year i was able to drop roughly 30 kgs going all the way down to ~94 kgs. My weight hit plateau there but i was fairly satisfied. Since February this year and with corona and whatnot i gained about 15 kgs and hit 110 kgs.
I started working out when the gym opened and going to my dietitian and lost around 4 kgs then i decided i want to build muscles so i increased my dietitian increased my protein intake and i gained some muscle mass  and lost fat. But my weight is the same.
I want to stop being so dependant on my dietitian so i am using an app called (lose it) to count my calories.
But i cannot find the answer for my question, which is? How much carb, protein, fat, and calories, should my daily intake be to burn fat while gaining muscles. And i am talking about bulking good amount of muscles.

My weekly training is 4 days for resistance exercise and 2 days for cardio (110 minutes of cardio each day)

,workout,"So, as the title says, I've noticed a while ago that my left leg (Mostly my thigh) is slightly weaker and smaller than my right leg. I understand that most people's muscles will never be perfectly even, but this differences is noticable enough that it actually makes running excercises more difficult for my left side. 

I want to understand how exactly I'm supposed to even the muscles in my two legs out, and how long it would take. 

I already know that I would have to perform unilateral leg excercises in order to even the legs out, since bilateral excercises force me to lean to my right. 

But the question I have is, how many unilateral reps and sets do I perform for each leg. See, some people say I should work my left leg more than my right leg, so it catches up quicker.

So for example, I would perform 100 split squats on my right leg, but I would then perform 150 split squats on my left leg, since that legs needs the extra work.

This idea makes sense to me, but than there are people telling me that I should work both legs to the same degree, even if one leg is lagging behind. I've heard that by doing this, the two legs will naturally even themselves out. 

So in this instance, I'd perform 150 split squats on both legs. 

So, I'm a little confused here. How exactly am I supposed to go about this exercise? Should I work my weaker leg a little more, or should I work both legs to the same degree. And if you don't mind, how long would the process of evening out my legs take?

I’ve been lifting for about a year and half now ( started about February 2019).

I don’t really know what to do at this point and I feel like I have bad genetics for building muscle like I should have made way more progress for lifting this long. Should I just eat more even tho I’m already at a pretty high bf%? When I have tried to eat in a surplus I found that I put on fat very easily even when gaining at a reasonable rate (1lb per week).

,workout,"Hi guys,
Im 23 years old and weighing 78kg / 171lbs on 186cm / 6.1ft. From the beginning of the year 2019 till now I went down from about 100kg / 220lbs to my current weight and now I really want to gain some muscle. I don’t know how much percentage of my body is actually fat but the most of it is at my bottom belly and I would like to lose this too. I will go to an actual gym so I have the possibility to use professional equipment but the problem is I don’t know how to start off. Should I start with a whole body workout + cardio or a split?

Im 23 years old and weighing 78kg / 171lbs on 186cm / 6.1ft. From the beginning of the year 2019 till now I went down from about 100kg / 220lbs to my current weight and now I really want to gain some muscle. I don’t know how much percentage of my body is actually fat but the most of it is at my bottom belly and I would like to lose this too. I will go to an actual gym so I have the possibility to use professional equipment but the problem is I don’t know how to start off. Should I start with a whole body workout + cardio or a split? Would really appreciate some help because I want that to come off good right from the beginning and I’m kind of overwhelmed by all the information on the internet.

Last Monday, I did a pretty intensive arm workout after a pretty long gym hiatus.

I’ve recently started some home exercises and found out that my lower back and core have basically 0 strength. I can barely do situps and my body starts vibrating and gives in after 5 seconds of planking. 

I race crosscountry where core strength is really important for maintaining balance and sprinting in short bursts. Due to my weak lower back and core, my posture suffers a lot on the bike as I rest forward on my wrists instead of holding myself up.

After my evening workout I will also have a protein shake (syntha 6 performance) with water and a tablespoon of mct oil.

I&amp;#39;m on my 4th week of a workout routine I&amp;#39;ve made up, I&amp;#39;m aiming for mostly strength, not aiming for the muscle man look, this workout takes me about 30 mins and leaves me reasonably tired, (weigh 75ish kg) (only have a 10kg dumbell, not looking for more equipment)
1. 5 sets of 6 bicep curls, 10kg
2. 5 sets of 12  bench press  10kg
3. 5 sets of 12 crunches (mon,wed,fri only)
4. 5 sets of 6 curl with press, 10kg
5. 3 sets of 10 press ups
I do this mon,tues,thur,fri. 30 second break between reps, about a min between workout, number 4 is particularly hard, no idea how bad my form is,

,workout,"Coming up to almost a year now, I ran into possibly one of the most day to day ruining injuries - I don’t mean to make it seem like the end of the world, it is no more than an obstacle that I have to work with. - I was on an incline leg press doing my last set. I was adjusting my form, and position when there was a sharp, yet blunt pain in my lower back. It was pretty harsh, though bearable. When I left the gym to get in my gym partner’s car. Is when I had made it worse. To help understand. I’m 6’3, and my boy drives a Toyota C-HR. Small little vehicle, and I have to bend forward to get in. Which is when I had the worst of the pain. Leading to not being able to walk without harsh pain, moving my back in any direction would cause me to drop to the ground from how much it hurt. 

I went to physiology to figure out what was going on, as within a week the pain subsided. In which they told me after a few sessions that I likely have a partially torn disc. Which would take quite some time to recover from. As there’s a lack of blood flow in that region, slowing down recovery time. Since then, here and there I’d always find a way to ‘reset’ that injury. In which I’m back to step one in recovery. Few weeks ago while doing a tire change on an F150, I picked up the tire. Bending forward - which I’ve been advised to not do for many things day to day - that ended up ‘reseting’ the injury. Was out of work for a solid for days, because I could barely walk. 

I’m seeking a little advice/ info on exercises for legs and back that I can do to get around the chance of injuring myself again. Ever since that accident, I’ve almost say ‘fear’ returning to ever doing leg press again. I sure as hell won’t touch deadlifts do to the injury. All my physio said to do, was to avoid doing anything that requires bending forward, or twisting my core side to side.

,workout,"Background: I’m a 25 year old female who considers herself to be in somewhat good health and somewhat fit. I worked in a restaurant for over a year and so I was used to carrying around heavy objects. 

When I got invited to take a physical agility test for practically my dream job (aka animal control officer), I started immediately to go out and walk to the gym every two days. I’d workout while practicing everything on the test which were Sit ups, Sit and reach, Bench press, leg press, and steps. Each category had points ranging from 1 to 3 and to pass I needed 8 points. So for 1 point in the bench press, I needed to bench press half of my body weight (which is 135 or so) and so I bench pressed 76 easy on the bench press at the gym. I tried 90 pounds and that was a bit harder, but I did it. So going into the test yesterday, I had a crap ton of confidence that I could do it! 

All of that was shattered when I tried their so called ‘bench press’. Instead of a normal bench press where my arms start above my chest (which I had practiced on), their’s was where I had my elbows start below my body and you have to push all the way up if that makes any sense. I couldn’t even lift 76 pounds. I was so pissed. They let me move on and try again, but I still couldn’t do it and I wasn’t the only female who couldn’t either. What truly pisses me off even more is that they had the exact type of bench press that I could lift 90 pounds on and I couldn’t use it instead when I asked nicely.

,workout,"Hey guys, 

Before we go any further I wanna make clear that I do have both my arms, but one of them has a pretty bad nerve entrapment on the elbow which requires surgery. 

A bit of background. I am a very very unlucky MMA practitioner, who recently got surgery on both my knees and my right elbow due to a tough fight I had. I’ve never been really muscular and ripped, I have a slim build that’s worked ok for me in the past while fighting, but recently I’ve had the idea to get more buff. Unfortunately, during my recovery from surgery, due to over compensation, my left arm got hurt, my cubital nerve got entrapped which generates a lot of pain and strength and mobility loss. I can’t get a surgery till next May due to my work (and since I already recently took quite some time off due to my previous injuries). So I have 10 months in which I can’t get surgery but I can’t also really use my arm very much. My doctor said the nerve shouldn’t suffer permanent damage as long as I keep it rested, iced and do my stretches until we can go ahead with the surgery (and luckily my job doesn’t require me to use my arm very much). 

But... I still wanna go ahead with my goal of getting fit again, and hopefully ripped at some point. Do you guys have any suggestions what exercises or routines I could use? What muscles could I work? In general what I could do to get fit and looking good without using my left arm at all? Is it even possible?

&lt;p&gt;But... I still wanna go ahead with my goal of getting fit again, and hopefully ripped at some point. Do you guys have any suggestions what exercises or routines I could use? What muscles could I work? In general what I could do to get fit and looking good without using my left arm at all? Is it even possible? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for your input. Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

So I was thinking maybe I could set one day aside a week to weight lift and train every muscle group, giving me a one day rest.

,workout,"Hey everyone. Im a 183 cm tall dude who currently weighs 230 pounds. I use to weigh like 180 in hs and im only 21 now so i think i put on a few pounds in college ahahah. Now i want to get back into shape. Im aiming to weigh around 190 to 200 as i think at 180 i was too skinny. I want to first lose weight then start working on building muscle and working on distance cardio.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I downloaded an app to get me started which has this workout routine:

\- 20 seconds highstep

\- 30 seconds of jumping jacks

\- 8 situps

\- 12 russian twists

\- 16 heel touches

\- 15 butt bridges

\- 10 bicycle crunches

\- repeat from russian twists to bicycle crunches

\- stretches   


I follow this up with prob about a 1.5 km bicycle ride

&amp;#x200B;

Now my goal is to lose weight right now. I know diet is also key but at the moment I cant afford to buy vegetables all the time so im eating instant oatmeal in the morning, a sandwich for lunch, and a decent sized meal for supper (usually with a good protein source, another carb source, and when I can afford it, vegetables) .

&amp;#x200B;

Im a 183 cm tall dude who currently weighs 230 pounds. I use to weigh like 180 in hs and im only 21 now so i think i put on a few pounds in college ahahah. Now i want to get back into shape. Im aiming to weigh around 190 to 200 as i think at 180 i was too skinny. I want to first lose weight then start working on building muscle and working on distance cardio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I downloaded an app to get me started which has this workout routine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 20 seconds highstep&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 30 seconds of jumping jacks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 8 situps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 12 russian twists&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 16 heel touches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 15 butt bridges&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 10 bicycle crunches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- repeat from russian twists to bicycle crunches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- stretches   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I follow this up with prob about a 1.5 km bicycle ride&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my goal is to lose weight right now. I know diet is also key but at the moment I cant afford to buy vegetables all the time so im eating instant oatmeal in the morning, a sandwich for lunch, and a decent sized meal for supper (usually with a good protein source, another carb source, and when I can afford it, vegetables) .&lt;/p&gt;

So I’m trying to put on some muscle as I’ve always been a skinny guy but my meals just don’t seem to cut it anymore .the meals are big and at the time of eating then they are quite filling but as I’m working out like 5 times a week and I’m still very hungry in the evenings.do I have a 4th meal or just further increase my meal size ?

Example of what I would eat in a day :

Breakfast :big bowl of cereal 

Lunch:2 plain ham bagels,banana,yoghurt,strawberries,grapes,yoghurt and rice crackers 

Dinner: 2 chicken breasts ,potatoes,peas and carrots 

All of this seems a lot to me but maybe I’m missing something here?(this alternates btw) if not chicken I’ll have steak or fish or something completely different on the off time I’m feeling it.ill also change the potatoes to rice or the peas and carrots to peppers and cucumber  but I already have a meal plan set out for me .

I want to simplify my workout but I don't want to create any imbalances.

I do lots of dumbbell / trap bar deadlift workouts now because that's all I have access to but I want to try doing more pushups/pullups instead.

Would this be a good workout to switch it up for a month?

Monday - 3 sets of pull ups / 3 sets of pushups

Tuesday - heavy deadlifting day

Wednesday - 3 sets of chin ups / 3 sets on pull ups

Thursday - lighter/more reps deadlifting day

Friday - 3 sets of pull ups / 3 sets of pushups

Saturday - ?

Sundays - my usual rest day

I also mix in stretching/balance/core work throughout the week + cycling 2/3 times a week

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what y’all think about this, or if this is unhealthy / too ambitious, or you have suggestions that could help! I think this would get me feeling or looking good / feeling less bloated bc of all the beer I drank this weekend, but please I’m open to all suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit; I didn’t ask if this was a good idea or not. I know it isn’t. I know how to lose weight and it’s a long term thing. But all I asked for is a quick little few day program to feel less bloated / look more shredded for Friday. So please keep your judgements on why I want to do this and fitness guru testimonials on your extensive to yourself. A little background - I went from ~20-23 body to ~13-15 body fat over the course of a year and a half. I understand how long / how much dedication it takes.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m 32, 5’9” and 195lbs (which is to say I definitely have a lot of fat I’m trying to get rid of). I have been working out for a few weeks now regularly (3x a week) with some fun but challenging hikes in between. Going to a gym is not an option for me (for many reasons I will not go into on this subreddit). I started lifting 15# and have worked my way up to 20# and already feel like it’s time to start adding more weight. The problem is I only have a dumbbell set that basically maxes out at 20#. I can squeeze more weight onto one dumbbell but feel like I’m wasting time constantly taking weights off and on for different exercises. Right now weights cost a lot of money (I am a furloughed chef) and from where I am at are very hard to find. I keep seeing adds for resistance bands and on first glance I theory feel like this could easily and cheaply solve a lot of my problems being that I can’t really afford hundreds of dollars of free weights and am restricted to working out at home. How effective are resistance bands? Can I bulk up with them (not trying to get massive but fit and noticeably bigger). I have read a lot of conflicting information regarding them so I figured I’d ask around here. This is my current routine at 20# (my goal is to get to 50#) doing the full routine 3 times with 90 sec - 2 mins rest in between. By the 3 time I’m utterly exhausted and it takes me around 1:30:00 to complete. My arms have gotten a little bigger and stronger and I feel a lot better overall if not a little sore all the time.

&lt;p&gt;How can I effectively tone and tighten my lower stomach and help my face fat? I’ve never really had to do extensive workouts so this isnt something I know much about. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

,workout,"I Want To Be Stronger &amp; Have Muscles

Hey Everyone!

I’m a 6’2 Male and I weigh 61KG. That’s 187 - 190 cm and that’s about 134 lbs

I want to gain weight, I definitely eat a lot more than I used too, if anything I’ve lost a few KG. I am very inactive, I basically never exercise.

I want to achieve a weight of 80 KG. I want to be broader, as I am very skinny right now. I want to build lean mass and have muscles. I want to be very strong. I know this takes time, perhaps years and years. I mean, I should’ve took the advantage of Lockdown. I was at home since Mid March, that’s 4 months. Anyways. It’s better to start now than never, right? I definitely want to see some results within a month. I know I’m not going to be 80 KG, If I work really hard perhaps I’ll gain a few KG. That’ll motivate me and push me harder to gain more and more weight.

I also have Asthma, my stamina is very bad. I get tired very quick and I am very unfit. 

I can’t do a push up.

There are so many different exercises to do and things to follow. 

I want to 
- Gain Weight (80KG Goal/176 lbs)
- Become Very Strong Or A Lot Stronger Than I Am Now
- Be Broader (As I Am Very Skinny Now)
- Have Better Stamina

My Questions:
1) Whats the minimum weight I can gain per week?
2) Can you please give me a plan? 
3) How much do I need to eat?
4) Should I focus on eating right now?

Please help me on my journey.

,workout,"Hi, whoever reads this! I'm a 17-year-old man and weigh about 200lbs (a little less) and am 6 foot 4. Right now, my Body Fat percentage is 22.4. I'm looking to get significantly toner (lose weight/body fat/chubbiness and gain muscle) and get that number down. I'm fully dedicated and willing to do whatever it takes. In specific though, I'm looking for a workout routine I can follow (and maybe a recommended diet plan (right now I'm doing a calorie deficient while I go to the gym for the first time and learn)). I'm really a novice in fitness as I've never been into sports or any athletics as a kid. My schedule is completely free and again, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get that body I have longed for. I would include pictures of my body right now but I'm now sure if that breaks any of the rules in this sub.

,workout,"Hi everyone! 

I guess I need your help with my routine. I’m new to working out and I’m a bit overwhelmed by everything. I’d like to lose shed maybe a few pounds (I’m 5’5 123 pounds), and would like to have a more toned body. 
I’m going to the gym 4 times a week at the moment, and doing cardio once a week, then one day is dedicated to my legs, one day to my abs and one day to my shoulders and arms. But I have the feeling that I’m not improving much because I only train each area once a week... should I train my whole body 3 times a week?

&lt;p&gt;I guess I need your help with my routine. I’m new to working out and I’m a bit overwhelmed by everything. I’d like to lose shed maybe a few pounds (I’m 5’5 123 pounds), and would like to have a more toned body. 
I’m going to the gym 4 times a week at the moment, and doing cardio once a week, then one day is dedicated to my legs, one day to my abs and one day to my shoulders and arms. But I have the feeling that I’m not improving much because I only train each area once a week... should I train my whole body 3 times a week? 
Also, I am drinking protein shakes. Should I drink one after cardio too ? 
I am eating quite whatever I want to be honest. Should I really be careful with what I eat to look toned or is working out sufficient ? &lt;/p&gt;

,workout," Adding workout in your daily routine is an important part of a healthy  lifestyle. But working out, in any way, weather you are playing a sport  or going to gym if not done properly can lead to minor as well as major  injuries in several cases. So, often it is recommended to wear some  safety gears in order to prevent such injuries. One of such gear is  Jockstrap or often known as Gym supporter. 

 

## So what is a jockstrap or a gym supporter?

A Jockstrap or supporter is an undergarment that helps to keep  testicles intact and support male genital. A lot of people don’t  understand its importance or the science behind it. And therefore  neglect using it. But as the saying goes “Prevention is better than  cure”. So today I am going to tell you how it works and why it is a  better and safer option to use a Gym supporter or a Jockstrap.

Supporter and Jockstraps are  considered to prevent Hernia .A Hernia is a condition where of abnormal  exit of a tissue or an organ. Such as bowel and other abdominal parts.

I’m 5’9”, 128 lb, 40 year old woman. I do not want to lose weight. 

So over the past few months I’ve been out of work (yay Covid). I have worked on my feet all my adult life, predominantly bartending. I’ve gone from working 4-5 days to almost no work. 

I’ve recently realized my butt (especially around tail bone) is often sore. I sit more now than I ever have. I also sleep on my back so that doesn’t help. And my posture is shit. 

Also just recently, there’s a droop in my butt to the point that I can now feel it touching the back of my thighs. I hate it. I’ve had a slight banana roll already, and now there’s more, both cheeks. 

I walk my dogs every day, anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes depending on weather. That’s my only exercise of late. 

I do have a gym membership, though I’d like some at home options, too. 

I’ve had all kinds of advice and I don’t know what to do. Deadlifts? Squats? Bridges? Resistance bands?  Stair master?
I’ve heard squats aren’t enough, and when I do them I often don’t feel much in my tush, but in my thighs.

,workout,"I’m hoping that this subreddit can give me some feedback on my beginner's strength training regime. I’ve been scouring the internet and reading articles/watching videos trying to put together a plan that works for me, because for reasons mentioned below I’m not able to go to the gym and have limited equipment at home. If anyone is willing to review my workout routine and meal plan to let me know what they think I would greatly appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Me

At some point during this quarantine I realized that I was starting to gain weight. I picked up running for the first time in my life and discovered that it made me feel fantastic – mentally and physically (I’ve been running consistently for the last three months, usually ranging from 3 – 8 miles). It also made me realize how many areas of my physical care I was neglecting. I’ve always tried not to go overboard with my eating – meaning reasonable moderation and avoiding chips and the like whenever possible, but I had never cared about it all that much. As I watched those five pounds melt away I realized how out of shape I was since I hadn’t done any sort consistent strength training since high school (when it was forced). I decided to take a deep dive and figure myself out while I still can. I’ve very recently learned that I have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the coronavirus, so my running is coming to a grinding halt and the gym is off the table. I do have membership to a gym that I’ve rarely used, but for purposes of quarantine and some other timing factors I am trying to build a routine based around the equipment I have available to me at home (which is admittedly limited).

Goal: Build up strength while maintaining low body weight. Let’s be honest, I want to be able to see my abs, flex in the mirror and be proud of my body for once in my life (not that this is necessary in order to be proud of your body, but it’s what I’d like to achieve). Based on what I’ve been doing so far I’m already seeing improvements all around (weight loss, toned calves (from running), starting to see the glimmer of some ab definition, arms are getting a little more muscled, etc.).

Age: 27

Height: 6’0

# Equipment

I don’t have much – I inherited a “Marcy by Impex” workout machine (This one isn’t mine, but it’s the same as what I have: [https://offerup.com/item/detail/581119396/](https://offerup.com/item/detail/581119396/)) It’s got a few different attachments not shown in those images, but fundamentally it has:

Seated Press

Seated Lat Pull-down

Seated Leg Curl

Chest Fly (? – Your elbows are bent so I don’t know if there’s a more appropriate name for this one)

There’s two other hooks on this – one right at the head for pulling forward with the V shaped grip you see in the second/third pictures, and one at the feet that you can see in the third picture at the very bottom. I don’t know how to use either one of these – I currently use the lower foot one with a (provided) chain and single hand grip to substitute some arm curls.

I also *just* got one of those door-frame pull-up bars and got that set up. It’s brand new though, so not actually part of my routine.

I don’t have a bench, barbells, dumbbells, medicine ball, or really anything else besides what I already said. And considering how hard/expensive those things are right now I wasn’t planning on buying them any time soon. Part of me was playing around with following some YouTube guides and building some basic racks myself and buying a dumbbell and really improvising with it, but (A) I realize how dangerous that is to build something like that, especially since I live alone and don’t have a spotter and (B) I can’t leave the house for two weeks now.  
   
 

# Workouts

I’ve summarized my current plan that I’ve been using mostly for about a week. The long runs are not time based and I’m far from a fast runner, though I do try and push myself a bit on the short runs. For my upper body workouts I mostly just go through say, 4x10 reps on a variety of exercises until I can’t do them anymore, then I lower the weights once and get good and tired then call it. This is unstructured and not a good long-term strategy, but as a beginner I feel like it helps me ease into the routine without overdoing it and is better than nothing.

Exercise Routine so Far: \~3 Months of consistent running, slowly adding in some ab training (\~2 weeks ago), adding in some upper body training (\~1 week ago), adding in some lower body and yoga training (a few days ago).

Sunday: 5 Mile “Long” Run (\~50 minutes), Strength/Flexibility Focused Yoga (\~30 minutes)

Monday: 3 Mile “Quick” Run (\~30 minutes), Ab Training (\~10 minutes using cheesy 90’s 8-minute-ab videos as suggested by a mainstream youtuber), Lower Body Training (\~30 minutes)

Tuesday: Ab Training (\~10 minutes), Upper Body Training (\~30 minutes)

Wednesday: 3 Miles “Quick” Run (\~30 minutes), Lower Body Training (\~30 minutes), Yoga (\~30 minutes)

Thursday: Ab Training (\~10 minutes), Upper Body Training (\~30 minutes)

Friday: 3 Mile “Quick” Run (\~30 minutes), Ab Training (\~10 minutes), Lower Body Training (\~30 minutes)

Saturday: Ab Training (\~10 minutes), Upper Body Training (\~30 minutes)

If you made it to the end then I sincerely appreciate you taking your time to review my plan! Thank you.",t2_12kk39,False,,0,False,Roast My (Beginner's At-Home) Strength Training Plan,[],r/workout,False,6,,0,,False,t3_hx4pww,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1595636391.0,text,6,,,text,self.workout,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that this subreddit can give me some feedback on my beginner&amp;#39;s strength training regime. I’ve been scouring the internet and reading articles/watching videos trying to put together a plan that works for me, because for reasons mentioned below I’m not able to go to the gym and have limited equipment at home. If anyone is willing to review my workout routine and meal plan to let me know what they think I would greatly appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Me&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point during this quarantine I realized that I was starting to gain weight. I picked up running for the first time in my life and discovered that it made me feel fantastic – mentally and physically (I’ve been running consistently for the last three months, usually ranging from 3 – 8 miles). It also made me realize how many areas of my physical care I was neglecting. I’ve always tried not to go overboard with my eating – meaning reasonable moderation and avoiding chips and the like whenever possible, but I had never cared about it all that much. As I watched those five pounds melt away I realized how out of shape I was since I hadn’t done any sort consistent strength training since high school (when it was forced). I decided to take a deep dive and figure myself out while I still can. I’ve very recently learned that I have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the coronavirus, so my running is coming to a grinding halt and the gym is off the table. I do have membership to a gym that I’ve rarely used, but for purposes of quarantine and some other timing factors I am trying to build a routine based around the equipment I have available to me at home (which is admittedly limited).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goal: Build up strength while maintaining low body weight. Let’s be honest, I want to be able to see my abs, flex in the mirror and be proud of my body for once in my life (not that this is necessary in order to be proud of your body, but it’s what I’d like to achieve). Based on what I’ve been doing so far I’m already seeing improvements all around (weight loss, toned calves (from running), starting to see the glimmer of some ab definition, arms are getting a little more muscled, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age: 27&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Height: 6’0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weight: 161.2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neck (Inches): 15&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abdomen (Inches): 31&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biceps (Unflexed): 11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle: Sedentary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimated Body Fat Percentage (based on Navy Calculator): 13%&lt;/p&gt;

,workout,"This is a one-stop shop for all weight-related questions -- also known as cutting/bulking/recomp. Ideas, suggestions, guides, workouts, etc -- everything you'll need to answer 99% of questions! This is meant to be a community/collaborative effort, so please add in suggestions in the comments!

To be clear on a couple terms -- when exercising and eating to gain weight, that is called **bulking** (aka caloric ""surplus""). Eating less to lose weight is called **cutting** (aka caloric ""deficit""). And eating just enough to not gain or lose weight is called **maintenance** (aka recomposition or ""recomp"").

#A visual guide to male and female BF% estimates

* [From athleanx](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8IPmtkFYQx/?igshid=17upb60h7gk3)

I don’t like guessing BF% as there’s no way to know how much visceral fat we store internally. But athleanx’s general guidelines are as good as any for visual estimates.

#Who should cut or bulk?

The idea behind cut and bulk cycles is to gain muscle and fat in a bulk phase and then try to keep all your muscle and burn off fat in a cut phase. This approach is generally 'faster', when done correctly, than ""recomps"" (recompositions) where you maintain your weight but work out hard and try to replace fat with muscle.

Generally speaking, if you're an active person and/or consistently working out, you can do cut/bulk cycles. To get started, you need to know your **maintenance** calories (""maint"") to have an idea on how many calories you can consume without gaining or losing weight, hence the term maintenance; no change in weight. To bulk, you eat more than maintenance (aka ""surplus"") and to cut you eat less than maintenance (aka ""deficit""). If you *are not* working out and you bulk, that's how you get fat. So don't eat above maint if you're not also working out. 

#Getting started

To get started, you need to know your ""maintenance"" calorie needs and for an estimate you need a TDEE calculator (I like [this one](https://tdeecalculator.net/), but you can google for others). Think of this as a starting point to use that will need some adjusting over time.

Once you have an estimated maintenance, you generally add 250-500 calories for a bulk and subtract 250-750 calories in a cut. Generally, it's safer to over-do cuts and under-do bulks. In a bulk you gain both fat and muscle and after a point you only gain fat (fat stores faster than you can build new muscle), so be cautious in bulks and don't ""dirty"" bulk. 

#Deciding to cut or bulk

So far as I'm aware, there isn't a hard science behind *when* to bulk or cut, but there are guidelines to consider. When bulking, our bodies build muscle *and* store fat and, after a point, our bodies prioritize storing fat over building muscle. This is why dirty bulking is bad and, generally speaking, if your BF% is &gt; 20%, you should not bulk. Any higher BF% and your body tends to prioritize fat storage vs muscle gained from bulking.

Similarly, cuts are usually done to around 10% because any lower than that and the body will begin to consume more muscle than fat and muscle loss is more likely.

You *can* make strength gains on a cut. You can't build new muscle, but you can ""refactor"" (that's my word for it, I'm sure there's a scientific one) existing muscle to be more efficient, hence stronger, as you lose fat. Also, repetitive gym visits will help you become more proficient at working out which helps in the long run when you start bulking and building new muscle.

If you're really unsure, you can make a post in /r/BulkOrCut to get community feedback on what it's you personally should do.

If you're skinnyfat, generally you can eat at a small maintenance (aka ""clean bulk"") and make great strength gains. If you have little muscle mass to cut to, you will just look tiny/thin -- especially if you're tall. So for most skinnyfat people, and I would clean bulk and diligently follow a legit lifting routine. Which brings me to...

#Workout routines

Before getting into routines, I think it's worth mentioning first that **everyone should walk more**. At least 5 times per week, 30 minutes per day:

* [Get ripped. Get walking.](https://www.t-nation.com/training/get-ripped-get-walking)

Check out [The Beginner's Guide to Working Out](https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/ihz264/beginners_guide_to_working_out/).

The best workout routine is the one you can consistently follow. If you're new to the gym, just about anything will get you some results. To a point. If you want to be smart about it, **do not make up your own routine!** There are plenty of legit, tried-and-true, FREE [recommended lifting routines](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/) to choose from. I like these routines vs googling something random because these are routines many, many people in various subreddits are doing and have done in the past that can help answer any questions you might have. It's nice to have someone else that is doing or has done the program you're running to offer direct advice from their experience. But you can just google other routines if you want. Just make sure it has:

* 1) Progressive overload

* 2) Structured days to not hit body parts more than 2x/week

If you're working out at home, check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/GovSchwarzenegger/comments/flz3es/stay_at_home_stay_fit/) from Arnold Schwarzenegger with a detailed bodyweight home routine.

Also another great [full body workout](https://www.instagram.com/p/CA3ajQZjUTx/) for people at home with no equipment.

#What to eat

At the end of the day, for 99% of people (various diseases, ailments, and conditions aside), all that matters are Calories In, Calories Out (CICO). This controls weight **gain** and **loss**. Lifting heavy weights encourages **strength gains** or at least strength maintenance in both surplus/bulks and deficit/cuts. But to gain or lose lbs on a scale, the total calories consumed minus calories used and the resulting surplus/deficit are what matters. But how much of what you eat matters...

There's a lot of suggested science over what to eat, but there are generally sound rules of thumbs to follow which are easily broken down into ""Macros"" for tracking purposes:

* Proteins (1 gram = 4 calories)

* Carbs (1 gram = 4 calories)

* Fats (1 gram = 9 calories)

Collectively, all the macros we consume = total consumption (Calories In). When cutting, it's easiest to cut down fats and carbs. But keep protein high. When bulking, generally you add carbs and/or fats. Protein should always be high; it's what helps build muscle directly.

However, *how we feel* when consuming these calories and what we get out of other nutrients is important.

##Fats

We all need healthy fats to help regulate hormonal balances. This is usually room-temp fats (think extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, various nuts, avocados, etc); less important are the fats in meat and dairy products, for example. A general rule of thumb is to aim for at least **30% x total calories** for your fats macro. This is the same for cutting or bulking, but when bulking you can increase if you want.

E.g. if you're consuming 2000 calories daily, aim for 0.3x2000 (600) calories to be from fats.

##Carbs

Next come carbs. Carbs are not evil. They're a tool. Our body prefers and relies on carbs to refuel energy stores. Simple, nutrient-dense carbs are preferred -- not complex or junk carbs. The reason for this is 1) satiation, how long we'll feel full, and 2) other nutrient content. When you can, get your carbs from fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. That will do far more for you than crackers, cereal, donuts, etc. Even though the carbs will be utilized equally, produce holds far more vitamins and minerals that have relevant health and recovery benefits that can't be overstated.

Generally, aim for **25-45%** of your calories to be carbs (depending on cutting/bulking).

##Protein

Generally, you want to keep protein fairly high. Anywhere from **.75-1+ gram of protein per lbs of body weight.** This can come from any source, as our body will utilize them the same. But some sources are preferred, depending on whether you're cutting or bulking. Ideally, aim for now more than 40-50 grams per meal/protein shake and spread out the consumption through the day.

The remainder of your calories should be protein.

##Timing

As carbs are for energy, many people prefer to have more carbs timed around workouts (and no fats during this period) to help boost performance and recovery. If you're going to eat your carbs (e.g. rice and chicken breast), do so about two hours before working out; otherwise, liquid/quickly consumed carbs are preferred (e.g. orange or apple juice). Again, post-workout, get simple carbs and protein into your system via a shake or meal fairly soon. Save fats for well-before or after workouts.

#Measuring success

First and foremost, gym progress should always be factored in first. If your routine says X lift should go up Y amount each week, generally you want to be hitting that to know you're on track. If your lift #s are going up according to your routine, you're doing great! If you aren't, there's a breakdown somewhere and you should ask for guidance if you cannot asses the fail point yourself.

Secondly, the weight scale. You want to make sure your body weight is trending in your goal direction. It's ideal to weigh yourself *the same way* every time. 

For example, I wake up, go to the bathroom, and then weigh myself every day for three weeks and then I average my daily changes over those three weeks. I generally aim to gain .5-.75 lbs per week and lose .75-1 lbs per week. If I'm gaining or losing too much, I adjust my macros ~ 250 calories and measure again for three weeks and so on.

Don't get caught up daily changes; I sometimes vary 3-5 lbs between days! Weigh daily for three weeks and average it out. Don't worry about the daily weight, find an average to determine where the trend is taking you and adjust if needed. This will take the annoying variances out of the picture and let you focus on meaningful change.

You can also measure your wrists, waist, neck, etc, as well as take photos, but that's more preference and not as commonly suggested.

#Bulking and cutting strategies

I've seen people make amazing progress, both gaining and losing weight, in a variety of ways. Ideally, be healthy. Emphasize fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. But, at the end of the day, **many approaches work**. You can bulk or cut as a vegan, intermittent fasting (""IF""), KETO, IIFYM, etc. Many approaches work. They are but tools available to you, so find one that best helps you meet your goal. So choose the best ""diet"" or tool that helps you achieve a goal! If that's keto, great! If that's caveman, awesome. I don't care! Limit your calories in whatever ""diet"" you choose and you'll see results.

In my opinion, it's better to make *lifestyle* changes that to follow a diet for a short time. So I don't really like ""diets"" per se, but more so recommend eating like an adult and limiting calories. But even still, different tactics can help in that goal, and you can deploy as many or as few as you want:

* Intermittent Fasting (""IF"")

* Tracking macros / IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros)

* ""Banking"" calories

I don't buy into the other 'benefits' of **IF**, but it was a tactic that worked for me. I am a volume eater. I generally eat well, but I like eating *a lot*. So when I'm cutting, my meals were small and sad. The idea behind IF is that you have a short window of time which you eat meals, the rest of the day you fast. Again, all that matters are calories. You can absolutely get fat eating 10k calories in a 5 hour window. So there's no magic in doing this. But for me, doing IF allowed me to have larger, more satiating meals within the ""eating window"" instead of more, smaller meals.

**Macros** are discussed above, but the idea behind IIFYM is that you've a set # for each macro and, so long as what you're eating fits neatly into the prescribed macro allotment, go for eating whatever you want! And, again, so long as total calories are low enough for you, you will lose weight. But this is /r/BulkorCut, not /r/weightloss. People here are also working out. **How well you workout, recover, perform, feel, etc** is affected by what you eat. So, sure, add in ""fun"" foods sometimes. But don't eat like a child simply because it fit your macros. A safe rule of thumb is to eat ""cleanly"" 80% of the time when bulking, whatever the other 20% of the time. When cutting, I try to eat cleanly 90-95% of the time with fewer treats. What that treat is might change -- some weeks I just want pancakes, other weeks I just want a couple beers. Do what works for you, just do so in controlled quantities.

I liked **""banking"" calories** when I knew I had a special event, date night with the wife, party, or whatever where I'd be consuming extra calories. One way to account for that is to deduct an *additional* amount of calories each day leading up to the event, to then splurge on that event. Example:

Let's say my maintenance is 2,500 calories and I'm eating at a -500 deficit, so I'm eating 2,000 calories daily. I want to take my wife out for our anniversary, so the week leading up to our date night I deduct an additional -250 calories each day and only eat 1,750 calories daily. This gives me 7x250 (=1750) ""banked"" calories I can add to my 2,000 calories on our anniversary. Now I can have a nice dinner, dessert, a drink or two, all without blowing my diet out of whack!

#Body fat % (BF%) estimates

Estimating ones body fat % is kind of hard. We can't see how much fat is stored internally around organs; some people store more fat over the abs, some more around their love handles (that's me!), and others in their legs/ass. So it's really hard to tell. There are various ways to scan BF%, but most are imprecise with a +/- 20% variance. In my opinion, the only thing they're useful for is estimating BF% *changes*. Let's say it reads 20% for you; in six months, you try again and it says 15%. You probably lost around 5% BF%, but your actual BF% might be 12%-18%. So it's not a particularly accurate reading, but the rate change is a useful gauge.

The best ways to learn BF% are via:

* Underwater Weighing (Hydrostatic Weighing) (1-2% variance)

* DEXA scan (1-2% variance)

Everything else has huge variance and is only useful for measuring rate of change.

&lt;p&gt;To be clear on a couple terms -- when exercising and eating to gain weight, that is called &lt;strong&gt;bulking&lt;/strong&gt; (aka caloric &amp;quot;surplus&amp;quot;). Eating less to lose weight is called &lt;strong&gt;cutting&lt;/strong&gt; (aka caloric &amp;quot;deficit&amp;quot;). And eating just enough to not gain or lose weight is called &lt;strong&gt;maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; (aka recomposition or &amp;quot;recomp&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B8IPmtkFYQx/?igshid=17upb60h7gk3""&gt;From athleanx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t like guessing BF% as there’s no way to know how much visceral fat we store internally. But athleanx’s general guidelines are as good as any for visual estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Who should cut or bulk?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind cut and bulk cycles is to gain muscle and fat in a bulk phase and then try to keep all your muscle and burn off fat in a cut phase. This approach is generally &amp;#39;faster&amp;#39;, when done correctly, than &amp;quot;recomps&amp;quot; (recompositions) where you maintain your weight but work out hard and try to replace fat with muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, if you&amp;#39;re an active person and/or consistently working out, you can do cut/bulk cycles. To get started, you need to know your &lt;strong&gt;maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; calories (&amp;quot;maint&amp;quot;) to have an idea on how many calories you can consume without gaining or losing weight, hence the term maintenance; no change in weight. To bulk, you eat more than maintenance (aka &amp;quot;surplus&amp;quot;) and to cut you eat less than maintenance (aka &amp;quot;deficit&amp;quot;). If you &lt;em&gt;are not&lt;/em&gt; working out and you bulk, that&amp;#39;s how you get fat. So don&amp;#39;t eat above maint if you&amp;#39;re not also working out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Getting started&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, you need to know your &amp;quot;maintenance&amp;quot; calorie needs and for an estimate you need a TDEE calculator (I like &lt;a href=""https://tdeecalculator.net/""&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, but you can google for others). Think of this as a starting point to use that will need some adjusting over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have an estimated maintenance, you generally add 250-500 calories for a bulk and subtract 250-750 calories in a cut. Generally, it&amp;#39;s safer to over-do cuts and under-do bulks. In a bulk you gain both fat and muscle and after a point you only gain fat (fat stores faster than you can build new muscle), so be cautious in bulks and don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;dirty&amp;quot; bulk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Deciding to cut or bulk&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far as I&amp;#39;m aware, there isn&amp;#39;t a hard science behind &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; to bulk or cut, but there are guidelines to consider. When bulking, our bodies build muscle &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; store fat and, after a point, our bodies prioritize storing fat over building muscle. This is why dirty bulking is bad and, generally speaking, if your BF% is &amp;gt; 20%, you should not bulk. Any higher BF% and your body tends to prioritize fat storage vs muscle gained from bulking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, cuts are usually done to around 10% because any lower than that and the body will begin to consume more muscle than fat and muscle loss is more likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make strength gains on a cut. You can&amp;#39;t build new muscle, but you can &amp;quot;refactor&amp;quot; (that&amp;#39;s my word for it, I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a scientific one) existing muscle to be more efficient, hence stronger, as you lose fat. Also, repetitive gym visits will help you become more proficient at working out which helps in the long run when you start bulking and building new muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re really unsure, you can make a post in &lt;a href=""/r/BulkOrCut""&gt;/r/BulkOrCut&lt;/a&gt; to get community feedback on what it&amp;#39;s you personally should do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re skinnyfat, generally you can eat at a small maintenance (aka &amp;quot;clean bulk&amp;quot;) and make great strength gains. If you have little muscle mass to cut to, you will just look tiny/thin -- especially if you&amp;#39;re tall. So for most skinnyfat people, and I would clean bulk and diligently follow a legit lifting routine. Which brings me to...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Workout routines&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before getting into routines, I think it&amp;#39;s worth mentioning first that &lt;strong&gt;everyone should walk more&lt;/strong&gt;. At least 5 times per week, 30 minutes per day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.t-nation.com/training/get-ripped-get-walking""&gt;Get ripped. Get walking.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best workout routine is the one you can consistently follow. If you&amp;#39;re new to the gym, just about anything will get you some results. To a point. If you want to be smart about it, &lt;strong&gt;do not make up your own routine!&lt;/strong&gt; There are plenty of legit, tried-and-true, FREE &lt;a href=""https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/""&gt;recommended lifting routines&lt;/a&gt; to choose from. I like these routines vs googling something random because these are routines many, many people in various subreddits are doing and have done in the past that can help answer any questions you might have. It&amp;#39;s nice to have someone else that is doing or has done the program you&amp;#39;re running to offer direct advice from their experience. But you can just google other routines if you want. Just make sure it has:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Progressive overload&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Structured days to not hit body parts more than 2x/week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What to eat&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, for 99% of people (various diseases, ailments, and conditions aside), all that matters are Calories In, Calories Out (CICO). This controls weight &lt;strong&gt;gain&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;loss&lt;/strong&gt;. Lifting heavy weights encourages &lt;strong&gt;strength gains&lt;/strong&gt; or at least strength maintenance in both surplus/bulks and deficit/cuts. But to gain or lose lbs on a scale, the total calories consumed minus calories used and the resulting surplus/deficit are what matters. But how much of what you eat matters...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of suggested science over what to eat, but there are generally sound rules of thumbs to follow which are easily broken down into &amp;quot;Macros&amp;quot; for tracking purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins (1 gram = 4 calories)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbs (1 gram = 4 calories)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fats (1 gram = 9 calories)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, all the macros we consume = total consumption (Calories In). When cutting, it&amp;#39;s easiest to cut down fats and carbs. But keep protein high. When bulking, generally you add carbs and/or fats. Protein should always be high; it&amp;#39;s what helps build muscle directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;how we feel&lt;/em&gt; when consuming these calories and what we get out of other nutrients is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all need healthy fats to help regulate hormonal balances. This is usually room-temp fats (think extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, various nuts, avocados, etc); less important are the fats in meat and dairy products, for example. A general rule of thumb is to aim for at least &lt;strong&gt;30% x total calories&lt;/strong&gt; for your fats macro. This is the same for cutting or bulking, but when bulking you can increase if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. if you&amp;#39;re consuming 2000 calories daily, aim for 0.3x2000 (600) calories to be from fats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Carbs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next come carbs. Carbs are not evil. They&amp;#39;re a tool. Our body prefers and relies on carbs to refuel energy stores. Simple, nutrient-dense carbs are preferred -- not complex or junk carbs. The reason for this is 1) satiation, how long we&amp;#39;ll feel full, and 2) other nutrient content. When you can, get your carbs from fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. That will do far more for you than crackers, cereal, donuts, etc. Even though the carbs will be utilized equally, produce holds far more vitamins and minerals that have relevant health and recovery benefits that can&amp;#39;t be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, aim for &lt;strong&gt;25-45%&lt;/strong&gt; of your calories to be carbs (depending on cutting/bulking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Protein&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, you want to keep protein fairly high. Anywhere from &lt;strong&gt;.75-1+ gram of protein per lbs of body weight.&lt;/strong&gt; This can come from any source, as our body will utilize them the same. But some sources are preferred, depending on whether you&amp;#39;re cutting or bulking. Ideally, aim for now more than 40-50 grams per meal/protein shake and spread out the consumption through the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of your calories should be protein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Timing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As carbs are for energy, many people prefer to have more carbs timed around workouts (and no fats during this period) to help boost performance and recovery. If you&amp;#39;re going to eat your carbs (e.g. rice and chicken breast), do so about two hours before working out; otherwise, liquid/quickly consumed carbs are preferred (e.g. orange or apple juice). Again, post-workout, get simple carbs and protein into your system via a shake or meal fairly soon. Save fats for well-before or after workouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Measuring success&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, gym progress should always be factored in first. If your routine says X lift should go up Y amount each week, generally you want to be hitting that to know you&amp;#39;re on track. If your lift #s are going up according to your routine, you&amp;#39;re doing great! If you aren&amp;#39;t, there&amp;#39;s a breakdown somewhere and you should ask for guidance if you cannot asses the fail point yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the weight scale. You want to make sure your body weight is trending in your goal direction. It&amp;#39;s ideal to weigh yourself &lt;em&gt;the same way&lt;/em&gt; every time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I wake up, go to the bathroom, and then weigh myself every day for three weeks and then I average my daily changes over those three weeks. I generally aim to gain .5-.75 lbs per week and lose .75-1 lbs per week. If I&amp;#39;m gaining or losing too much, I adjust my macros ~ 250 calories and measure again for three weeks and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get caught up daily changes; I sometimes vary 3-5 lbs between days! Weigh daily for three weeks and average it out. Don&amp;#39;t worry about the daily weight, find an average to determine where the trend is taking you and adjust if needed. This will take the annoying variances out of the picture and let you focus on meaningful change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also measure your wrists, waist, neck, etc, as well as take photos, but that&amp;#39;s more preference and not as commonly suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bulking and cutting strategies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen people make amazing progress, both gaining and losing weight, in a variety of ways. Ideally, be healthy. Emphasize fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. But, at the end of the day, &lt;strong&gt;many approaches work&lt;/strong&gt;. You can bulk or cut as a vegan, intermittent fasting (&amp;quot;IF&amp;quot;), KETO, IIFYM, etc. Many approaches work. They are but tools available to you, so find one that best helps you meet your goal. So choose the best &amp;quot;diet&amp;quot; or tool that helps you achieve a goal! If that&amp;#39;s keto, great! If that&amp;#39;s caveman, awesome. I don&amp;#39;t care! Limit your calories in whatever &amp;quot;diet&amp;quot; you choose and you&amp;#39;ll see results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it&amp;#39;s better to make &lt;em&gt;lifestyle&lt;/em&gt; changes that to follow a diet for a short time. So I don&amp;#39;t really like &amp;quot;diets&amp;quot; per se, but more so recommend eating like an adult and limiting calories. But even still, different tactics can help in that goal, and you can deploy as many or as few as you want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermittent Fasting (&amp;quot;IF&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking macros / IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Banking&amp;quot; calories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t buy into the other &amp;#39;benefits&amp;#39; of &lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt;, but it was a tactic that worked for me. I am a volume eater. I generally eat well, but I like eating &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. So when I&amp;#39;m cutting, my meals were small and sad. The idea behind IF is that you have a short window of time which you eat meals, the rest of the day you fast. Again, all that matters are calories. You can absolutely get fat eating 10k calories in a 5 hour window. So there&amp;#39;s no magic in doing this. But for me, doing IF allowed me to have larger, more satiating meals within the &amp;quot;eating window&amp;quot; instead of more, smaller meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macros&lt;/strong&gt; are discussed above, but the idea behind IIFYM is that you&amp;#39;ve a set # for each macro and, so long as what you&amp;#39;re eating fits neatly into the prescribed macro allotment, go for eating whatever you want! And, again, so long as total calories are low enough for you, you will lose weight. But this is &lt;a href=""/r/BulkorCut""&gt;/r/BulkorCut&lt;/a&gt;, not &lt;a href=""/r/weightloss""&gt;/r/weightloss&lt;/a&gt;. People here are also working out. &lt;strong&gt;How well you workout, recover, perform, feel, etc&lt;/strong&gt; is affected by what you eat. So, sure, add in &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; foods sometimes. But don&amp;#39;t eat like a child simply because it fit your macros. A safe rule of thumb is to eat &amp;quot;cleanly&amp;quot; 80% of the time when bulking, whatever the other 20% of the time. When cutting, I try to eat cleanly 90-95% of the time with fewer treats. What that treat is might change -- some weeks I just want pancakes, other weeks I just want a couple beers. Do what works for you, just do so in controlled quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;banking&amp;quot; calories&lt;/strong&gt; when I knew I had a special event, date night with the wife, party, or whatever where I&amp;#39;d be consuming extra calories.

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say my maintenance is 2,500 calories and I&amp;#39;m eating at a -500 deficit, so I&amp;#39;m eating 2,000 calories daily. I want to take my wife out for our anniversary, so the week leading up to our date night I deduct an additional -250 calories each day and only eat 1,750 calories daily. This gives me 7x250 (=1750) &amp;quot;banked&amp;quot; calories I can add to my 2,000 calories on our anniversary. Now I can have a nice dinner, dessert, a drink or two, all without blowing my diet out of whack!&lt;/p&gt;

,workout," As a personal trainer, I wanted to take the time to answer some of the most frequently asked questions by people who are new to working out. Feel free to let me know if I've missed anything!

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I lose weight?

It’s actually way simpler than you might think: maintain a caloric deficit. Consume fewer calories than you burn. It doesn’t matter of you’re morbidly obese or you’re cutting for a show, this basic principal still applies. Note that eating a healthy diet makes this **far** easier - lots of fruits, veggies, lean protein and water will help you stay satiated for far fewer calories than fatty junk foods (not to mention you’ll have way more energy, and just feel better).

To find out how many calories you should be eating in a day to lose weight, you have a few different options. The first is to determine your maintenance calories with an online calculator, then subtract 250-500 per day from that (to lose about 0.5-1lbs per week). 

The other option (my personal favourite, because everyone is different!) is to start by just honestly tallying up how much you’re currently eating each day. Once that’s determined, start by subtracting 250-500 calories per day. If you haven’t lost any weight in a couple weeks, subtract that amount again, until you start seeing progress.

There’s tons of food tracking apps out there, but I recommend [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) \- it’s free, easy to use, you can scan food labels, and the food database included is enormous.

Another important note - increasing the amount of calories you burn per day (ie. exercising) will also help you stay in a caloric deficit. However, it’s best NOT to rely solely on this method. Doing a whole hour of cardio will only burn a few hundred calories (plus will likely make you hungry for snacks by the time you’re finished) … or, you can simply avoid eating a bag of chips or a piece of pizza, to have the exact same effect. 

That’s not to imply that exercise isn’t important in your weight loss journey - quite the contrary! However, instead of focusing on doing hours of cardio a day, this should only be used to supplement your diet (1-2 hours a week is fine for most people). Your focus should instead be on resistance training. Lifting heavy weights 2-4 times per week plays the important role of ensuring you **maintain your muscle mass as you lose weight.** Want to avoid that “skinny fat” look, and get “toned” instead? Make sure you’re doing resistance training! 

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I lose weight in ___ area?

Unfortunately, spot reduction is a myth. Where you lose weight first (and last) is determined by genetics. However, you \*will\* eventually lose weight in all your problem areas. You just need to be patient, and keep doing what helped you start losing weight in the first place.

 The good news is, the more weight you lose, the more visible the progress will be (especially if you’re doing a good job focusing on just fat loss, while retaining muscle). Going from 250-240lbs probably won’t be noticeable, but losing those last 10lbs will make a huge difference (since a few pounds will make up a far greater percentage of your total body mass). So the progress will be hard-fought for, but definitely worth it! 

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I gain muscle?

It’s a combination of progressively harder resistance training, eating enough food, and lots of patience.

When you’re exercising, just going through the motions isn’t good enough. For optimal muscle gain, you should be performing each set with a weight that you can lift continuously for around 30-60s (this should amount to around 8-15 repetitions). If you feel like you can go for longer, choose a heavier weight. 

Perform each repetition slowly (about 1 second concentric, pause, 2-3 seconds eccentric, pause), through a full range of motion. To clarify - the concentric portion of a lift is when you’re moving against gravity, and the eccentric portion is when you’re moving with gravity. Exercises involving long static holds (like planks) are great for endurance, but they won’t amount to much muscle mass gained.

I cannot overemphasize how important good form is either - for avoiding injury, hardwiring the correct neural pathways, and maximizing muscle gain. Especially when you’re just starting out, choose light weights, and make sure optimal form comes naturally before you start increasing the intensity. It’s way easier learning it correctly the first time than fixing bad habits later.

How much food should you be eating? It varies widely between people. Start with your maintenance calories, add a couple hundred to that (it doesn’t have to be a lot!), and measure your results. Be patient with your progress - men can expect to gain 1-2lbs of lean muscle a month, and 0.5-1lbs for women (beginners may gain a little faster). Eating enough protein is also vital to gaining muscle - a general rule of thumb is around 1 gram of protein (each day) per pound of lean body weight (ie. how much you weigh, minus the amount of fat you have). 

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I get stronger?

It honestly depends on your experience level. If you’re just starting out, doing a normal resistance routine focused on gaining muscle will make you stronger. However, if you’ve been working out regularly for awhile (close to a year), using heavier weights (1-6 reps max) will help you get stronger a lot faster. 

If you’re focusing more purely on strength gain, it’s important that each repetition is done as perfectly as possible (even moreso than for other training goals). That means stopping 1-2 reps shy of failure. Doing just one sloppy rep can severely impact your strength output for the rest of the workout. Don’t be afraid of taking longer rests between sets either (up to 2-3 minutes), as you want to be ready with as much energy as possible before you start your next set. It also goes without saying that heavier weight = greater chance for injury, and proper form will help prevent that.

&amp;#x200B;

### Is it possible to lose fat and build muscle at the same time?

Contrary to popular belief - yes. Especially if you’re a beginner! Just make sure you’re eating around maintenance level calories (along with enough protein), doing resistance training 3-4 times a week, and you’ll start seeing body composition changes. 

However, if you’re significantly over/underweight, or have already been working out for some time, you’ll see much faster progress if you focus on one goal at a time. The main difference here is going to be diet - eating less if you’re trying to lose weight, or eating more if you’re trying to gain weight. Regular resistance training plays a part in both shedding fat and gaining muscle.

&amp;#x200B;

### How should I be structuring my workouts?

For the vast majority of people, full body workouts with compound exercises is the way to go. (For those who don’t know, compound exercises are those which use more than one joint at a time - think squats, bench press, rows, etc.)

The popular back/chest/shoulders/arms/legs split routine (or any variation of it) is good for advanced bodybuilders, but not ideal for beginners. Bodybuilders exercise like this because they need a much greater stimulus to properly stress any given muscle group, and more rest between days training that muscle group as a result of their increased workout intensity.

For a beginner, it’s better to hit each muscle group multiple times a week (this is great to hasten learning and growth). You won’t need as long of a rest period before training the same muscle again, because it won’t be as fatigued after each workout.

Compound exercises give you the greatest bang for your buck because you’re working out so many muscles in one movement (and burning way more calories at the same time). Isolation exercises (those working one joint at a time, like bicep curls or leg extensions) are best for bodybuilders who really need to hone in on a single muscle.

Doing resistance training 3-4 times a week is a good goal to shoot for. Workouts should be around 45-60 minutes, with around 6-8 exercises done during that time. Try to keep rests between sets to around 60s (this is all very generalized, and can change depending on experience level and goal). Space rest days evenly between workouts if you can.

Start your workouts with the exercises which require the most energy (usually those which involve lifting the most weight), saving any isolation/ab exercises for the end.

If you’d like some help planning your workout routine, I just released a fitness app called [PerfectFit](https://www.perfect-fit.app/). It gives you access to workouts designed by a personal trainer, all customized according to your unique goals, fitness level, and available equipment. There are tons of bodyweight exercises included - ideal for anyone working out at home! The app is currently available to download on Android, and iOS is hopefully just a few days away (currently under review).

&amp;#x200B;

### What should I be eating?

If your goal is a change in body composition (gaining muscle/losing fat), the amount of calories you’re consuming is the most important thing to pay attention to.

If you’re consistently working out hard but failing to gain/lose weight, chances are you need to make alterations to your diet. For weight loss, that usually means eating at a deficit of 250-500 calories per day; for weight gain, eating at a surplus of 200-300 calories per day.

What exact foods you’re eating has an impact on how easily you can stick to your calorie goals, as well as your energy levels.

Consuming around 1 gram of protein per pound of lean bodyweight (per day) is a given, regardless of what your fitness goal is. This helps to maintain satiety, and preserve/increase muscle mass.

Eating lots of fruits and veggies (as well as drinking 2-3L of water a day - more for some people) is a great way to feel full without consuming too many calories. It also just contributes to all-around health and energy levels.

Eating lots of fatty foods should be avoided if weight loss is the goal - not because fat makes you fat per se, but because they are so calorically dense. Only one tablespoon of peanut butter or olive oil is 100 calories! Conversely, if your goal is to **gain** weight, adding more fatty foods to your diet (healthy fats, if possible) can help you hit that calorie goal easier.

And carbs? Not as evil as people make them out to be. Think of them as the energy that fuels your brain and your workouts. Having around 50% of your calories coming from carbs is about the norm. It’s likely beneficial to raise this number even higher if you’re an especially lean individual, or you’re regularly working out at intense levels.

&amp;#x200B;

### When should I be eating?

The easiest way to time your meals properly is to think: “What will I be doing in the next 2-3 hours?” Eat according to the activity you’re about to do. That doesn’t mean you should be having a giant meal right before your workout, but ideally your biggest meal of the day would be several hours before you exercise. This will give you the energy you need, plus ensure the calories you consume are shuttled into your muscles instead of fat reserves.

If you’re about to do an intense workout, the best thing to eat beforehand (around 15-30 minutes prior) is a light snack of healthy carbs (like some fruit). For optimal recovery, aim for 20-30g of protein within an hour after you workout (if you miss this window though don’t worry about it). A protein shake is probably the simplest and most convenient way of doing this, but whole food is just as good.

&amp;#x200B;

### What supplements should I be taking?

If you have a healthy, well-rounded diet, including 2-3 cups of different veggies each day,  enough protein per pound of bodyweight (from sources that include sufficient amounts of each essential amino acid), and adequate omega-3 fatty acids - then you’re golden, and probably don’t need any supplements.

However, the vast majority of the population would probably benefit from a simple multivitamin and omega-3 supplement, just to help fill any nutritional gaps they have.

If you’re getting enough protein from whole food, then you probably don’t need to add protein powder. However, if you’re struggling with this, then protein powder is a great way to easily increase your daily protein intake. Whey protein is the most bioavailable and has a complete amino acid profile, so it’s the best choice for most people. However, if you’re vegan (or lactose intolerant), there are lots of plant proteins available. You just need to pay attention to the amino acid profile of each one (possibly mixing and matching different plant sources if you need to).

As for all the other supplements out there, it’s honestly on a case-by-case basis as to whether they’d actually help you or not. If you’re a beginner, unless you have any specific requirements or deficits, you probably don’t need them.

&amp;#x200B;

### Is stretching important?

Yes. Please stretch (or do some other form of myofascial release, such as foam rolling), or you’ll eventually regret it. Regular exercise makes your muscles slowly form clumps of tissue and fascia. Neglecting to release these can result in restricted range of motion, and eventually pain.

Static stretching should be done at the **end** of your workout. Aim to stretch each worked muscle near its end range of motion for around 60s total. Don’t stretch before your workout, as this can impede strength output.

&amp;#x200B;

### Is warming up important?

Yes. Warming up is paramount to increasing blood flow and activating your muscles properly before you move onto more intense, metabolically demanding exercises. 

Ideally, during your warm-up, you should be actively moving your muscles through the same ranges of motion you’ll be doing for your workout. This can be as simple as doing the exact same movement, but with minimal weight - for example, doing a few sets of bodyweight squats before doing barbell squats.

You want your warm-ups to elevate your heart rate, but not be so intense that they start tiring you out and detract from your workout. Usually 5-10 minutes of light activity is enough.",t2_7tzbnpvc,False,,0,False,Beginner's Guide to Working Out,[],r/workout,False,6,standard,0,,False,t3_ihz264,False,dark,0.99,,public,156,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Routine Help,False,156,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598611352.0,text,6,,,text,self.workout,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a personal trainer, I wanted to take the time to answer some of the most frequently asked questions by people who are new to working out.

This can be as simple as doing the exact same movement, but with minimal weight - for example, doing a few sets of bodyweight squats before doing barbell squats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want your warm-ups to elevate your heart rate, but not be so intense that they start tiring you out and detract from your workout. Usually 5-10 minutes of light activity is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

,workout,"Hey, i've been working out fir years now and have tried multiple different routines. Currently i've been trying  Jeff Cavaliere's full body workout:    
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6gZoAzAhCg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6gZoAzAhCg) 

I started to dislike this routine because it did not allow me to train my upper chest and the lateral delts. After 2 months of using this routine, I came across a different full body routine from a youtuber called Jeremy Ethier:  
PART 1 -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JmWguyvu7Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JmWguyvu7Y)   
PART 2 -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWcJuLKB7RY&amp;t=485s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWcJuLKB7RY&amp;t=485s) 

They're both pretty simmilar, exept Jeremy has a few excercises that I think are more preferable. I think both routines are great, but I wanted to make one that took the best out of both of them. That's why I made a new plan that I think looks quite promising.

\---NEW PLAN---  
A:  
squat (glutes/quads)  
hip thrusts (glutes/hams)  
bench press (chest/triceps)  
chin ups (lats/biceps)  
lateral raises (lateral delts)  
face pulls (rear delts)

B:  
deadlift (glutes/hams)  
bulgarian split squat (glutes/quads)  
incline db bench press (upper chest/triceps)  
ohp (anterior and lateral delts/triceps)  
rows (traps/rhomboids/rear delts)  
banded db curls (biceps)  
\---

**I was hoping if anyone could help me make sure all of the excersizes are in the correct order?** The idea is to complete the most taxing workouts first, and then make your way down. 

Another thing I dislike about Jeff's routine is his sets and reps. Most of the excersizes have a 3x5 structure, when according to this site  [https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-many-reps-should-you-do.html](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-many-reps-should-you-do.html) the best rep range is between 8-12 reps for maximum muscle hypertrophy.

,workout,"I never thought I would have to post this, but here we go. I’ve been a huge workout buff for years now. Started running when I was 8, started lifting when I was 15, and I’ve been working out consistently since then until now, at the age of 18. I also have had severe depression since about the age of 7, and I’ve learned how to push through it. I’ve learned how to clear my head and force myself to work out, even when I go weeks where I just so desperately want to lay on the floor in a ball and die. And now I’m starting to have trouble pushing through it, and I’m not sure what to do. I’ve been on a few different medicines and the one I’m on now works well, but stuff is starting to slip through again.

I also have had severe depression since about the age of 7, and I’ve learned how to push through it.

,workout,"Hi all, for those who have seen my last post here, I have been working hard to make gains and obtain muscle mass. After a few months of challenging myself to do more push ups and bicep/tricep exercises, I've noticed that my chest has expanded a little bit (which is good progress), but my left pec/side of my chest is a little bigger than my right. While it doesn't bother me too much, I'm a little concerned about it. Have I been doing something wrong? Is there a way to fix this? Another concern I have is my arms. Since my right arm is dominant, it's always been a little larger in size than my left arm. Once again, it doesn't bother me to the point where I'm annoyed, but I'd like to balance this out. 

The exercises I do for chest are: Regular Push ups, Chest Press Machine, Incline and Decline Pushups

The exercises I do for biceps/triceps are: Hammer Curls, Concentration Curls, Standing Dumbbell Curl, Zottoman Curl

So, I'm reaching out today to see if you guys have any suggestions as to how I can balance this out and make these muscles more proportionate in size. You can also read my previous post to see how my progress and for some context on how I'm doing. Keep in mind, I DO NOT have access to any indoor gym (although gyms are scheduled to open on Sep. 2 in NYC).

,workout,"Hi all, I am wanting to get back into exercising and could really use some guidance.

 For background, prior to covid I was seeing a trainer once a week for a little over a year and going to the gym 1-3 times a week outside of that session. I liked having the discipline and accountability of having a trainer, even if I wasn't feeling great (usually mentally) it still made me show up.

Now with covid, I've fallen out of a routine and into a bit of depression. I tried going to zoom work outs that my trainer was hosting but the timing was hard and I lost motivation after a couple months. My gym is allowing members to go in for training only and I'm honestly not comfortable doing so. I really liked my trainer but based on theirs and another trainers social medias I don't feel they're being safe.

Working out typically puts me in a good mood and helps me manage anxiety and depression. I just feel overwhelmed right now and don't know where to restart.

I was wondering if there are apps that you would recommend for a good workout but also have some level of motivation and accountability built into it? (May be asking for too much?) 

Alternatively, I recently came across the Tempo Home Gym. It's pretty expensive and has a monthly membership on top of it but I like the AI integration and that is corrects your form and makes recommendations. Has anyone purchased this or have thoughts around it?

Between gym membership and training, I was spending about $200 a month. My work also offers a $500 health and wellness stipend each year. So out of pocket I was investing about $1900 a year in to my health and fitness, I would like to not spend more than that unless it's some miracle app or machine but ideally saving a little money would be best.

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, I recently came across the Tempo Home Gym. It&amp;#39;s pretty expensive and has a monthly membership on top of it but I like the AI integration and that is corrects your form and makes recommendations. Has anyone purchased this or have thoughts around it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between gym membership and training, I was spending about $200 a month. My work also offers a $500 health and wellness stipend each year. So out of pocket I was investing about $1900 a year in to my health and fitness, I would like to not spend more than that unless it&amp;#39;s some miracle app or machine but ideally saving a little money would be best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies for such a long post, I am just hoping to find a little guidance after drowning in Google searches and being discouraged for the past couple months. Thank you as well for any help.&lt;/p&gt;

I hadn't really noticed until one day i stepped on the scale and weighed 197 lbs on july 24. as I've always been fit this came to a large surprise to me so i decided i needed to get back on track. I started tracking my calories and working out. I eat \~1500 calories a day, late breakfast i have 1 cup of egg whites, with a less than a teaspoon of avacado oil and maybe a quarter cup of cheese-- less than 300 calories. for lunch i have a protein shake and milk, syntha 6 140 calories + milk 130--270 calories. For dinner it fluctuates of course but i'm usually sitting at about 600-700 calories. then i have another protein shake late at night +270 all in all about 1500 calories.
